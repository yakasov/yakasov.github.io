              other players can provide assistance in most situations (GM
              discretion). only 1d20 can be rolled.

          <h3>Opposed Checks<a change7></a> (p16)</h3>
          an opposed check occurs between a GM and a player. the GM buys bonus
          dice with AP first, then the player.<br />the amount of successes the
          GM rolls sets the difficulty for the player. the player then can
          choose to spend AP to increase their dice.<br /><br />any excess
          successes award AP on either side.

          start of each turn, they must succeed an <b>END + Survival</b> check,
          with a difficulty equal to the number of injures they have, and a
          complication range of 19-20.<br /><br />if this check is passed, they
          survive that turn; if not, they die.<br />if they suffer any damage
          whilst dying, they gain another injury.

      <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Healing (p33)</h2>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility(this)">Show</button>
        <div>
          outside of the <b>First Aid</b> major action, there are other elements
          of healing: <br /><br />
          <h3>Stabilizing (p34)</h3>
          after succeeding a <b>First Aid</b> check, a patient can be stabilized
          to 1hp. this also prevents them from dying, meaning they no longer
          have to make checks to survive. the character remains unconscious.
          <br /><br />
          if <i>Radiation damage</i> has reduced their maximum hit points to 0,
          they cannot be stabilized until they have at least 1 max HP.<br /><br />
          AP can be spent to heal additional health points when stabilized at a
          rate of 1 AP to 1 bonus HP. <br />1 AP can also be spent to wake them
          from unconsciousness. <br /><br />
          <h3>Regaining Health (p34)</h3>
          passing a <b>First Aid</b> check will allow you to heal a number of
          hit points equal to your rank in Medicine.<br />you can heal an
          additional HP per AP spent.<br /><br />you can only heal the hit
          points of a stable character. <br />
          <br />
          <h3>Treating an Injury (p34)</h3>
          succeeding a <b>First Aid</b> check allows a patient to ignore the
          penalties of their injury - it is only patched up in this manner and
          not permanently healed.<br /><br />when a character suffers damage to
          a location of a treated injury, roll a d3<a change6></a> - if you roll
          a 1, the damage re-opens the wound and the character is injured again.
          <br /><br />
          <h3>Using Stimpaks (p34, 169)</h3>
          with the <b>Take Chem</b> minor action, the stimpak is injected and
          recovers 4 HP or treats 1 injury. this can stabilize a patient as
          well.<br /><br />with the <b>First Aid</b> major action, you may
          administer a stimpak as part of the action. the target regains 4 HP,
          and any spent AP heals twice as much HP. <br /><br />
          <h3>Healing Robots (p34)</h3>
          robots and other machines cannot recover from injuries naturally;
          however, robot repair kits can be used in place of stimpaks.
          <br /><br />
          attempting <b>First Aid</b> on a robot, a suit of power armour, or
          other large machines requires an <b>INT + Repair</b> check with a
          difficulty of 2.<br />this increases by 1 for each injury the machine
          has suffered.<br />passing the check restores HP equal to your
          <b>Repair</b> rating, treats an injury, or stabilizes a dying
          machine.<br /><br />machines cannot use chems or heal through eating,
          drinking or resting. outside of combat, an hour's work on a damaged
          machine restores HP equal to twice the <b>Repair</b> rating used.

        <h2>Long-Term Recovery (p35)</h2>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility(this)">Show</button>
        <div>
          there are three key ways to recover outside of combat:<br /><br />
          <h3>Rest (p35)</h3>
          resting for at least 6 hours regains all lost HP; resting for 8 in an
          owned bed boosts max HP by 2.
          <br /><br />
          when you sleep, injuries can be healed with an
          <b>END + Survival</b> check with a difficulty of 1. the complication
          range of this check increases by 1 for each untreated injury.<br />if
          the check succeeds, one injury can be recovered, with an additional
          injury for every 2 AP spent. <br /><br />

          <br />
          <h3>Food & Drink (p35, 149)</h3>
          food and drink restores the HP listed in their description. some
          consumables cannot be used during combat, especially if consumed
          raw.<br />
          roll a d3<a change6></a> when consuming irradiated food or drink; on a
          1, you suffer 1 Radiation damage. <br /><br />
          <h3>Medical Attention (p35, 194)</h3>
          characters may require long-term medical care if they've been injured,
          poisoned, or are suffering from a disease.<br />a single character can
          provide medical attention for a number of patients equal to their
          <b>Medicine</b> rating. <br /><br />for injuries, each day of rest a
          patient receives allows you to assist their
          <b>END + Survival</b> check at the end of the day to heal their
          injuries using your own <b>INT + Medicine.</b><br /><br />
          for poisons and diseases, you may still assist the check. if the
          patient spent the entire day resting, they reduce the difficulty of
          this check by 1.
          <br /><br />
          <h3>Recovering from Rads (p35)</h3>
          Radiation damage can <i>only</i> be removed by administering RadAway
          or any other chems that remove Radiation damage. <br />
          radiation damage is removed before any healing is applied if both are
          applied in the same turn.
