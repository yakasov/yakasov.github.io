        not a surprise to anybody who has ever heard me talk about anything. I
        ADORE this game to bits. I've played it many many times. it is *almost*
        perfect. I know it's weird I would put a not-perfect game first, but
        this list isn't specifically ordered so who cares. and it's probably my
        favourite anyway.
        <br />
        <br />
        set in 2114, you take control of a soldier with cyber-enhancements and
        go on a quest to kick ass against bugs, zombie-like dudes and metal
        midwives. the combat is satisfying, the environments are creepy, the
        story is chilling, the music is incredible (both atmospheric and
        adrenaline pumping) and SHODAN is one of the best villains ever.
        <br />
        <br />
        system shock 2 isn't *technically* an immersive sim (which is a made up
        genre), it's an 'action role-playing survival horror' game... which is
        close enough. immersive sim games are meant to emphasize player choice,
        allowing players to approach problems from multiple angles. for example,
        if you have a locked door, do you
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>kick the door in with your brute strength</li>
        <li>
          find the code hidden somewhere, maybe in some audio logs (note -
          you'll have to remember them when you hear them!)
        </li>
        <li>
          use a power to phase through the door, or teleport past the door
          through a tiny crack
        </li>
        <li>find a completely new way in by exploring</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        all of these are valid choices in most immersive sims, system shock 2
        included. immersive sims don't particularly like holding your hand, or
        giving you information outright - the best system shock 2 does is give
        you a map for you to fill out and a PDA that will link your objectives
        to certain levels in the game. past that, you're on your own.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>you should play if:</b> you like games at all. genuinely. there are
        very few, if any, instances where i would not recommend giving this game
        a go. it's like, 10 hours at most. just play it.

        putting this *directly* after System Shock 2 is potentially unfair,
        because System Shock 2 is sort of the mother of immersive sims. that
        game alone inspired all of Bioshock... and Prey.
        <br />
        <br />
        Prey is a game where you survive against aliens on a space station. and
        since it's an immersive sim, it pretty much lets you do what you want.
        broken door in the way? shapeshift into an alien and crawl under it...
        or fix it if you have the skills... or recycle it with a recycler
        charge... or -
        <br />
        <br />
        Prey is a much prettier game than System Shock 2 (it did come out 18
        years later, after all). and even though it came out in 2017, the
        graphics are still stunning 7(!) years on. it's another very atmospheric
        game that feels very satisfying to play... and arguably it has more
        content than System Shock 2, meaning exploring is a lot of fun.
        <br />
        <br />
        *unlike* System Shock 2, though, this game does hold your hand a bit
        more - it provides quests with set locations and will remind you of
        keycodes when relevant. a small note about both games is that you can
        type keycodes in with your numpad, which is always very fun.
        <br />
        <br />
        this game also has Benedict Wong voicing one of the two main
        deuteragonists, and I love that man's voice so much.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>you should play if:</b> system shock 2 seems too dated or
        old-looking. this game was made by Arkane, who also made Dishonoured, so
        the gameplay loop isn't too dissimilar - and it is a bit more modern
        than System Shock 2 in some aspects, I admit.

      <p>
        I could certainly argue that Fallout is my favourite franchise ever, but
        that would be because System Shock only has two games (and a remake).
        but... I do love Fallout - and Fallout 2, and Fallout 3, and Fallout:
        New Vegas, and yes, even Fallout 4 a good amount.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fallout is a game set in post-apocalyptic west coast America in 2161,
        after a nuclear war has ravaged the Earth only 90 years prior. you are
        tasked with finding a water chip for your super cozy vault, and
        therefore must explore the wastelands for a solution, all the while
        trying not to get killed by... well, everything, honestly.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fallout is not a very forgiving game. it tells you even less than System
        Shock 2 does, and even imposes a time limit on you before you fail your
        main quest (and therefore the game) entirely. in saying that, there is
        only one main quest - everything else is essentially optional.
        <br />
        <br />
        the combat system as well as player system is very similar to Dungeons &
        Dragons in the sense that combat is turn-based, the player is made up of
        points allocated to build themselves into the person they want to play
        as, and they gain (or lose) skills and perks along their quest. in fact,
        perks being in Fallout is potentially to credit for feats existing in
        Dungeons & Dragons 3e and onwards.
        <br />
        <br />
        the first Fallout in particular is incredible gritty. it really tries to
        beat you over the head with the fact that you are in a desolate
        wasteland, and everything is pretty depressing. people are surviving,
        there are settlements, but nothing really looks up. it's a harsh world,
        and believe me, you will feel it. but it's a very well written one, too
        - you can learn a lot about the world, and outside of the main quest,
        you don't feel like the main character - you are helping other people,
        but their lives will continue without your intervention.
        <br />
        <br />
        the real RPG aspects come in once you realise that the majority of
        quests are morally ambiguous. not every quest has a right or wrong
        choice, and often it's up to you to decide. what do you think is the
        best outcome for this world? do you care? you can be evil, if you want.
        you can even kill children - i won't judge (the game will, if you make a
        habit of it).
        <br />
        <br />
        additionally, the first Fallout has The Master - the hidden antagonist
        causing a lot of your strife. he is (or better, *it* is,) a mish-mash of
        a man, a woman and a computer, creating a genuinely terrifying and
        commanding presence,
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>you should play if:</b> you like Dungeons & Dragons and want to try
        it in a more sci-fi, apocalyptico setting. whilst the system isn't
        exactly 5e, it's similar in some ways, and you'll find it reminiscent of
        other hardcore RPG games.

      <p>
        A Hat in Time is very different to the other games so far - it doesn't
        have dark undertones, it's not apocalyptic, and it's not an immersive
        sim or a role-playing game.
        <br />
        <br />
        it's a platformer. you jump around, collecting hourglasses,
        collectibles, and hats. it's very comparable to Super Mario 64,
        Banjo-Kazooie and Spyro in the way it flawlessly executes the
        collectathon genre.
        <br />
        <br />
        this game is genuinely such a treat to play - it's incredibly fun,
        light-hearted, humourous without trying to pander or being 'down with
        the kids' and even has workshop integration. what's not to love? the
        controls feel tight, the movement is well-paced, the levels are built
        well and are fun to explore (and not a pain in the arse, cough cough
        Yooka-Laylee). not to mention it has DLCs which are pretty good (one is
        fantastic!!).
        <br />
        <br />
        A Hat in Time really departs from the previous games in the way it
        presents itself - it is cutesy and dumb and stupid and fun. it's not
        meant to be serious, which makes it wonderful and warming to play. you
        can stick your tongue out and blow raspberries; you can dance wherever
        you like; you can ride large cats like you would the subway; you can
        tell the devil off; you can solve a murder in a train full of owls and
        be convicted all whilst smiling along innocently. and at the end of the
        day, isn't that all anybody ever wants from a video game?
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>you should play if:</b> you enjoy platformers. this will 100% scratch
        the collectathon itch, and is much more modern than the titles in the
        genre that came before it. this is one game i hope to god has a sequel,
        because i really adore this game.
