                <li>
                  a tagged skill results in a crit success if roll is above 20 -
                  skill<a change3></a><br />
                  <i>eg Sneak 3 means crit above 17 (20 - 3)</i>
                </li>
                <li>a 1 generates a <i>complication</i></li>
                <li>if the number of successes > target, the check passes</li>
                <li>each bonus success becomes an AP</li>
                <li>you can improve the outcome by expending AP (p15)</li>
              </ul>
              a difficulty 0 is an automatic success, but generates no AP.
              <br />
              you can choose to attempt the check to gain AP, but also risk
              complications<br /><br />
              other players can provide assistance in most situations (GM
              discretion). only 1d20 can be rolled.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Opposed Tests (p16)</h3>
          an opposed test occurs between a GM and a player. the GM buys bonus
          dice with AP first, then the player.<br />the amount of successes the
          GM rolls sets the difficulty for the player. the player then can
          choose to spend AP to increase their dice.<br /><br />any excess
          successes award AP on either side.

            <li>
              <b>lucky timing:</b> at the start of any round in combat, you may

          difficult actions can result in complications at higher rolls (p17).
          for example, a difficulty 3 roll could create complications at a roll
          of 3 or below<a change4></a>.<br /><br />
          in some cases, the GM may allow a success even when the success goal
