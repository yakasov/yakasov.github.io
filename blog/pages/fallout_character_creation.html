          some of your skills are Tag skills, marking them as your areas of
          expertise. a Tag skill increases your chance of a critical success.<br />when
          you use a Tagged skill, each d20 that rolls at least 20 - your skill
          rank<a change2></a> is a critical success.

        <h2>Derived Statistics (p47, 48)</h2>
        <button onclick="toggleVisibility(this)">Show</button>
        <div>
          as well as your S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes and skills, you also have a
          number of derived statistics. these are passive elements of your
          character generated by your stats.

          <h3>Carry Weight</h3>
          your carry weight is how much gear you can carry. you can carry 150lbs
          of equipment plus your STR x 10 <br /><br />

          if your total weight exceeds your carry weights, several penalties
          begin to apply:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>above your carry weight,</b> all STR and AGI checks increase in
              difficulty by 1, you cannot Sprint, and your Initiative is reduced
              by 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>50lbs above your carry weight,</b> the difficulty of these
              checks increases by 1 more, and your Initiative drops by 1
              again.<br />these penalties continue for every additional 50lbs
              added.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>at double your carry weight,</b> you cannot move, you fail any
              STR or AGI based checks, and your Initiative is set to 0.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Initiative</h3>
          your initiative is equal to your PER + AGI. this is a static number
          that determines your place in the turn order and isn't subjected to
          any checks.

          <h3>Defense</h3>
          your Defense statistic is the basic difficulty of any attacks made
          against you. it is based on your AGI attribute.<br />
          you always have 1 Defense; above 9 AGI, you gain an additional 1
          Defense.

          <h3>Damage Resistance</h3>
          damage resistance (DR) is subtracted from damage inflicted of the same
          type <i>before</i> it reduces your health.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Physical damage resistance</b> mostly stems from clothing and
              armour, and varies by hit location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Energy damage resistance</b> also stems from clothing and
              armour and works similar to Physical damage resistance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Poison damage resistance</b> is a single value for your entire
              body, helping you fight against toxins and the like.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Radiation damage resistance</b> is rare but often vital, and is
              dependent on hit location. some creatures, such as super mutants,
              ghouls and robots, are immune to Radiation damage.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Health Points</h3>
          your starting maximum HP is determined by your END + LCK. you gain
          additional HP points when levelling up, or through perks.

          <h3>Melee Damage</h3>
          your melee damage lists any bonus damage you do with melee weapons or
          unarmed attacks. you do not always gain bonus damage if your STR is
          not high enough.
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>STR Value</th>
              <th>Bonus Dice</th>
