static and unmoving, lying there like a pile of trash <br />
<br />
i am under the covers, under the blankets, in a dirty dressing gown, unmoving <br />
<br />
my legs are unbearably hot; they need to move, but no nerve is firing <br />
<br />
i cannot will any muscle to budge; i cannot force any inch of my skin to twitch or react <br />
<br />
i close my eyes and try and force anything to move at all, but nothing is happening. when my feet are uncomfortable, they can readjust, but that's the end, nothing else will start <br />
<br />
she comes in and looks at me in my disgusting heap, my disheveled state, and smiles, touching my cheek. she loves me even for my void in my head <br />
<br />
i want to cry out for her. i wanted to when she was in the kitchen, i want to now, but all i can do is focus my eyes forward on the wall. my mouth won't budge. my tongue is frozen. if i spoke my disgusting breath would escape <br />
<br />
when she leaves i can urge my right foot only to breach the blankets and covers, and feel the cold air outside. then my right leg can move the rest of the blankets off, or at least try. it takes time <br />
<br />
it's always my legs that move first. i don't know why, maybe they're furthest from my brain with a disease that rots me <br />
<br />
even now when i type this, i lie on a bed, and all i want to do is push the laptop away, and lie here forever, rotting away, achieving nothing, decomposing slowly into dust - but there are people who would notice, and i can't disappoint anybody <br />
