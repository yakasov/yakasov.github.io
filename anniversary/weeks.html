     <h3><i>This page is dedicated to my wonderful girlfriend <b>Katie</b>, who in the past year (since 11.11/18) has shown me just how happy life can be.<br>
            I owe the world to her as she's made mine a place I want to live in forever; she's the girl of my dreams and every day I am surprised I can call her mine.<br>
            She is incredibly smart, always focused on her work, has amazing wit and her laugh has enough happiness to lift the whole world up.<br>
            I love you so much, Katie. You're so awesome - in both ways ;)</i></h3>
