I think I might be depressed again <br />
<br />
I don't think it leaves or goes away, but it feels like it's back <br />
I don't know why <br />
<br />
If I lie down on the bed, I won't move <br />
I'll lie there, unmoving, wasting away <br />
My lips glued, my arms like lead <br />
Unable to speak, or cry out, unable to move away or change things <br />
<br />
I want someone to move me, but I don't want to be touched <br />
I want someone to hear me, but I don't want them to speak <br />
I am crying out for attention, but not making a sound <br />
<br />
I am frustrated with myself, angry at my inability to be angry <br />
I am angry at my frustration, frustrated because I can't do anything <br />
I want to punch something, and I want it to hurt, but I don't want to hurt myself <br />
I want to break something, reduce something to nothing, but I don't want to break anything <br />
<br />
My head feels like it's surrounded by dark clouds <br />
No thunder, or lightning, just thick nothingness <br />
My brain is full of a deep fog that I can't see through <br />
I can't say what I want to say; my mouth won't move <br />
<br />
I feel like a drone; I move like a drone <br />
I get up and I start work <br />
And soon I realise I don't know what I'm doing <br />
I stare at the screen, or at my desk, or at my hands, and nothing is happening <br />
No thoughts are forming, no sparks are flying, no neurons connecting <br />
<br />
If I can start a train of thought, I cannot articulate it <br />
If I stop it, I know I won't be able to start it again <br />
I can't say how I feel, and I don't know what I feel <br />
<br />
I wish I could tell my partner <br />
I wish I could tell her how much she means to me, truly <br />
How her attempts to help me do help <br />
I don't want to be a burden, I don't want to make her sad <br />
I could never believe that being like this isn't a burden <br />
But I won't hurt myself <br />
For her <br />
