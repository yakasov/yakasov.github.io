	  <h2><i><b>Haiku: </b>
      a Japanese poem of seventeen syllables, in three lines of five, seven, and five, traditionally evoking images of the natural world.</i><br>
     _______________________ </h2>

     <h3><i>This page is dedicated to my wonderful girlfriend <b>Katie</b>, who in the past year (since 11.11/18) has shown me just how happy life can be.<br>
            I owe the world to her as she's made mine a place I want to live in forever; she's the girl of my dreams and every day I am surprised I can call her mine.<br>
            She is incredibly smart, always focused on her work, has amazing wit and her laugh has enough happiness to lift the whole world up.<br>
            I love you so much, Katie. You're so awesome - in both ways ;)</i></h3>
     <h2> _______________________ </h2>

     <h3><b>0: </b>'That's not a fart okay'<br>
                   'I'd happily sword fight tho'<br>
                   Calm before the storm</h3>

      <h3><b>1: </b>Want to go for lunch?<br>
                    I can bring the dark orange<br>
                    Wait, are we a thing?</h3>
      <h4><i>Before our first ever date (where we went to Cali Country Park - I messaged her asking if she wanted to meet up, kind of hiding the fact nobody else was going)
             I went to the one stop - that's where we decided we would meet. I planned to get a chocolate orange to share since they're so nice, but I saw a dark chocolate one!
             Naturally, I bought it straight away, and it was a huge mistake. Eating near a full dark chocolate orange is a good way to get stomach aches.</i></h4>

      <h3><b>2: </b>'James Charles mermaid vid'<br>
                    He just said YASSS QUERN - oh no<br>
                    James and me = mistake</h3>
      <h4><i>This haiku is in reference to us finding a James Charles video together, and we forced ourselves through it.
             The video in question is 'Halloween Makeup Tutorial' (I think) - probably not worth watching.
             The last line would've worked better from my perspective 'Katie and I', but that's too many syllables. :(</i></h4>

      <h3><b>3: </b>Comfy on Oli's couch -<br>
                    'I COULDNT CARE HOW BIG IT<br>
                    IS IN THE SLIGHTEST'</h3>
      <h4><i>Around this time was the Star Wars marathon - although lines 2 and 3 don't need explaining.</h4></i>

      <h3><b>4: </b>You fulfill my life<br>
                    Occupying me at work<br>
                    Ollie in a fez</h3>
      <h4><i>Katie kept me company whilst I was working tediously long and boring shifts in Laundry or whilst on Housekeeping.
             One thing we spoke about whilst at work was her dance classes - and Ollie Binney is in her classes, and I know him personally.
             Seeing him in a fez made my night, and I can still remember it well.</i></h4>

      <h3><b>5: </b>(League's) a BAD GAME UH<br>
                    'I forgot doors existed...'<br>
                    Pre-Christmas party</h3>

      <h3><b>6: </b>Ryan and his knuckles<br>
                    Uncomfiest couch ever<br>
                    Best New Years ever</h3>

      <h3><b>7: </b>I'm going to Farn!<br>
                    You wish you were male for me?<br>
                    Turns out Katie's gay</h3>

      <h3><b>8: </b>Getting my (two) Wiis<br>
                    Getting my mental health right<br>
                    Watching Glass - actually...</h3>
      <h4><i>'actually...' since it definitely wasn't worth seeing, so probably not worth including in a sentimental haiku.</i></h4>

      <h3><b>9: </b>'Let's build a PC!'<br>
                    Rest in Peace, young Swim Shady<br>
                    Holocaust photo</h3>

      <h3><b>10: </b>Talking over Fortnite<br>
                    'This guy's cool, has a nice voice'<br>
                    Be my new duo?</h3>

      <h3><b>11: </b>Yarn Yoshi in Smash<br>
                     Marie Kondo: you spark joy!<br>
                     Need more romance, babe</h3>
      <h4><i>The third line isn't a reference to Katie and I, but more a couple in Cleaning Up with Marie Kondo.
             If I remember correctly, there was a highly annoying American couple that we kept joking about, and the wife was constantly saying how they 'need more romance
             in their life, babe'.</i></h4>

      <h3><b>12: </b>Finding my iPod<br>
                     Much cooler as a wee boy<br>
                     'That is one bad boy'</h3>

      <h3><b>13: </b>'DON'T STOP THE GROPING'<br>
                     'even cleaned the vag' - true love<br>
                     'YOURE SUCH A FURRY'</h3>

      <h3><b>14: </b>Brendan gives her life<br>
                     PANIC! With Mystery Inc.<br>
                     DUCKS CAN FLY YOU ID-</h3>

      <h3><b>15: </b>Drunken messaging<br>
                     Great romantic after shots<br>
                     Katie back from Spain</h3>

      <h3><b>16: </b>'My moist face bf'<br>
                     Conditioner works on face<br>
                     Just sleep, 'don't bruh me'</h3>

      <h3><b>17: </b>Meaningful VCs<br>
                     'You're not gay cuz you're not gay'<br>
                     Katie best support</h3>
