It was the successor of the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer that also saw use during the Clone Wars, although it constituted a far more imposing example of walker technology. Heavily armored and awe-inducing, the AT-AT positioned itself as the standard of Imperial firepower on the battlefield.</p><p>In 14 BBY, the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis hijacked one AT-AT on the planet Kashyyyk.</p><p>In 4 BBY, the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus led three early AT-AT walkers on an assault on the desert planet of Seelos against the Spectres and three retired clone officers aboard an AT-TE.</p><p>AT-ATs were used again in 3 BBY against the Spectres, when Princess Leia Organa arrived on the planet to give the Ghost's crew three Sphyrna-class corvettes. Two walkers were deployed to patrol the transports' landing platform, which were formally on Lothal to offer supplies to citizens impacted by the rebel efforts. When the rebels tried to steal the corvettes, the Ghost started firing on the AT-ATs. Four proton torpedos were not powerful enough to destroy one of the walkers, and it was necessary for Kanan Jarrus to use his lightsaber to cut its legs, toppling it. The second one was knocked down by the engines of the last Hammerhead, piloted by Ryder Azadi.<br></p><p>In 2 BBY, Lieutenant Yogar Lyste deployed two AT-AT walkers, Walker 271 and Walker 414, to combat an attack on the east gate of the Imperial Armory Complex by members of the Lothal resistance led by Ryzder Azadi. The rebels Kanan, Ezra Bridger, and Chopper escaped in the stolen AT-DP Walker 216. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn realized that the rebels had hijacked the AT-DP walker and ordered his AT-ATs to crush them. One of the AT-AT walkers proceeded to crush the AT-DP under its heavy body but the rebels managed to use their lightsabers to cut their way aboard. Morad Sumar also fired a rocket which hit one of the walker's legs. After knocking out the AT-AT pilots, the two climbed out and escaped with Ryder's cell into the wilderness.<br></p><p>Thrawn then deployed four of these during the battle on Atollon. Jedi survivor Kanan Jarrus then destroyed one with his lightsaber. The Bendu then destroyed two of the AT-AT walkers. However, the last one shot Bendu down from the sky.<br></p><p><b>Galactic Civil War<br></b></p><blockquote><p><i>"That armor's too strong for blasters. Rogue group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go for the legs; it might be our only chance of stopping them."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Luke Skywalker, during the Battle of Hoth</span></p></blockquote><p>Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, a new AT-AT model was introduced. At this time, the Alliance to Restore the Republic stole a number of AT-ATs and provided them to Saponza's Gang.<br></p><p>During the Rebel assault on the Imperial weapons factory moon of Cymoon 1, a group of Rebels led by Han Solo and Leia Organa stole an AT-AT from Weapons Factory Alpha. They used the walker to escape from the factory after they sabotaged its main power core to explode. During their escape, Solo fired a shot that nearly killed the Sith Lord Darth Vader, using the AT-AT's powerful quad laser cannons. Soon after, Vader managed to overtake the Rebels in their escape and cut down the massive walker's back left leg. The AT-AT fell tremendously and its passengers barely escaped the wreckage before fleeing Cymoon 1 entirely for the safety of the Alliance Fleet.<br></p><p><b>Battle of Hoth<br></b></p><p>During the Battle of Hoth, General Maximillian Veers led a squadron of at least five AT-ATs on the icy fields of Hoth to knock out the shield generator that protected Echo Base, the Rebel headquarters. The triumph of Veers' squadron allowed the Imperials to invade Echo Base and rout the Rebels, striking a major blow in the war. However, the battle also revealed that the AT-ATs could be toppled by a cable wrapped around their legs. Although that weakness had been used effectively by the Alliance on Hoth, the Empire continued to use these mechanical behemoths in the later stages of the war, and at least 1 was present on Endor prior to the Battle of Endor.<br></p><p>Shortly after the battle of Endor, the rogue agents of Inferno Squad Iden Versio and Del Meeko used an AT-AT in order to escape Vardos, during Operation: Cinder. In 5 ABY, at least one AT-AT walker was stationed at Camp Sardo on the planet Kashyyyk. During the Liberation of Kashyyyk, several Wookiee guerrilla fighters, including Kirratha, hijacked the AT-AT walker and threw out the crew. Later, AT-ATs were deployed against New Republic forces during the Battle of Jakku.<br></p><p><b>Rise of the First Order<br></b></p><p>Decades after the war, a young scavenger named Rey used one of the downed AT-ATs, designated Hellhound Two, as her home on Jakku.</p><p>The First Order used an updated version of the AT-AT as an escort to its newer AT-M6s.<br></p><br><br><br><br><h1>AT-RT</h1><br><h2>Unaligned</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"Affirmative, AT-ST support is on the way."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- An Imperial technician</span></p></blockquote><table class="userscript-table userscript-table-bordered" style="width:615.455px"><tbody><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Manufacturer</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Kuat Drive Yards</li><li>Imperial Department of Military Research</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Class</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">Combat walker</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Cost</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><p>Not available for sale</p></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Length</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">4,5 meters</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Height</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">9 meters</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Mass</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">12.100 kilograms</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Cargo capacity</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">200 kg</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST), also known as a Scout Transport, Scout Walker, or derisively as a chicken walker, was a lightweight, bipedal walker used by the ground forces of the Galactic Empire. Later, the First Order used an updated variant of the AT-ST within their military.</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><blockquote><p><i>"The AT-ST kept spitting lasers at us, and we kept sinking lower and lower into the snow. Each blast took another bite out of the lip of the trench."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Chanda Bethari describes an AT-ST firing on Hoth</span></p></blockquote><p>AT-STs were commonly used to screen the flanks of larger assault walkers for major ground operations. The Empire used them for swift reconnaissance and troop support. As such, they were essential for cleaning up minor resistance along the path of a planned invasion route, and could quickly eliminate any small threats that evaded an AT-AT's barrage. The walker was commonly used on anti-personnel hunting missions, and was piloted by two AT-ST drivers with superior skills of balance and agility.</p><p>AT-STs were equipped with two chin-mounted MS-4 twin blaster cannons capable of firing at a range of two kilometers. It also featured one cheek-mounted 88i twin light blaster cannon and one cheek-mounted DW-3 concussion grenade launcher capable of doing massive damage to enemy vehicles and ground troops at close range. They were excellent at dealing with large amounts of infantry as well as mounted turrets that were too risky to be taken out with rocket launchers. Its clawed feet could slash apart wires and fences at ground level.</p><p>Reinforced armor plates enveloped the control cabin, protecting the two-person crew. Its two armored viewports were deliberately set to give any viewer the unsettling sensation of staring into the face of a soulless beast or oversized combat droid. Inside the control cabin, the command module featured a holographic 360-degree view of the combat zone. The "head" itself was capable of rotating 240 degrees side to side, greatly benefiting the gunner's target-acquisition abilities and capabilities for destruction. The walker's deceptively rickety gait belied a potent patrol vehicle. Gyros, flexible joints, footpad sensors, and shock absorbers formed a sophisticated system that controlled balance and stabilized the walker across a variety of terrains.</p><p>Despite its speed and agility, an AT-ST walker's offensive and defensive power were significantly compromised. Offensively, its weapons systems were only good against lightly armored targets at close range. Defensively, its lighter armor could repel attacks from small-arms fire, but not laser cannons, missiles, or other heavy ordnance. Its armor did not cover its entire frame, lest the walker lose its agility. Striking the walker's unprotected gyros underneath the command module could destabilize the walker and cause it to fall. Additionally, deep trenches or cable lines leveled at the height of the AT-ST's ankles and knees could cause it to trip and topple the vehicle.</p><p>The modular design of the All Terrain Scout Transport allowed for ease in customizing the walker with armaments and tools for specific mission parameters. Mortar launchers were one such weapon that could be attached to the command pod of the AT-ST.</p><p>The Ewoks of Endor discovered that the AT-STs were vulnerable to anti-Gorax traps. Ramming logs could smash through the walker's head, destroying the cockpit. One of its other weaknesses was its susceptibility to hijacking, despite the height of the vehicle seemingly making hijacking an impossibility. A sufficiently strong force could rip the entrance hatch off the top of the walker. If commandeered, the walker's cannons could easily penetrate other AT-STs' armor.</p><h3>Variant models</h3><p><b>AT-ST Mark III</b></p><p>The AT-ST Mark IIIs were equipped with experimental armor that provided more speed and durability than that of the standard AT-ST.

I guess it wanted to keep us from flanking it's big cousins."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Chanda Bethari's account of fighting an AT-ST on Hoth</span></p></blockquote><p>Part of the All-Terrain walker family, the AT-ST's role in supporting Imperial ground operations earned it the moniker "scout walker" owing to its ability in ferreting out enemy positions and inspecting locations in advance of larger walkers. It was better equipped than the Republic AT-RT.</p><p>The Imperial Military commonly used the AT-ST in a variety of environments. At least one AT-ST was deployed on Jedha in 0 BBY in a battle during the planet's insurgency. The walkers were also used in the Galactic Civil War, and between the Battle of Yavin and Battle of Hoth, the Alliance to Restore the Republic operated stolen AT-STs, and provided them to Saponza's Gang, who often fought against the walkers.

Later, the First Order used an updated variant of the AT-ST within their military.</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><blockquote><p><i>"The AT-ST kept spitting lasers at us, and we kept sinking lower and lower into the snow. Each blast took another bite out of the lip of the trench."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Chanda Bethari describes an AT-ST firing on Hoth</span></p></blockquote><p>AT-STs were commonly used to screen the flanks of larger assault walkers for major ground operations. The Empire used them for swift reconnaissance and troop support. As such, they were essential for cleaning up minor resistance along the path of a planned invasion route, and could quickly eliminate any small threats that evaded an AT-AT's barrage. The walker was commonly used on anti-personnel hunting missions, and was piloted by two AT-ST drivers with superior skills of balance and agility.</p><p>AT-STs were equipped with two chin-mounted MS-4 twin blaster cannons capable of firing at a range of two kilometers. It also featured one cheek-mounted 88i twin light blaster cannon and one cheek-mounted DW-3 concussion grenade launcher capable of doing massive damage to enemy vehicles and ground troops at close range. They were excellent at dealing with large amounts of infantry as well as mounted turrets that were too risky to be taken out with rocket launchers. Its clawed feet could slash apart wires and fences at ground level.</p><p>Reinforced armor plates enveloped the control cabin, protecting the two-person crew. Its two armored viewports were deliberately set to give any viewer the unsettling sensation of staring into the face of a soulless beast or oversized combat droid. Inside the control cabin, the command module featured a holographic 360-degree view of the combat zone. The "head" itself was capable of rotating 240 degrees side to side, greatly benefiting the gunner's target-acquisition abilities and capabilities for destruction. The walker's deceptively rickety gait belied a potent patrol vehicle. Gyros, flexible joints, footpad sensors, and shock absorbers formed a sophisticated system that controlled balance and stabilized the walker across a variety of terrains.</p><p>Despite its speed and agility, an AT-ST walker's offensive and defensive power were significantly compromised. Offensively, its weapons systems were only good against lightly armored targets at close range. Defensively, its lighter armor could repel attacks from small-arms fire, but not laser cannons, missiles, or other heavy ordnance. Its armor did not cover its entire frame, lest the walker lose its agility. Striking the walker's unprotected gyros underneath the command module could destabilize the walker and cause it to fall. Additionally, deep trenches or cable lines leveled at the height of the AT-ST's ankles and knees could cause it to trip and topple the vehicle.</p><p>The modular design of the All Terrain Scout Transport allowed for ease in customizing the walker with armaments and tools for specific mission parameters. Mortar launchers were one such weapon that could be attached to the command pod of the AT-ST.</p><p>The Ewoks of Endor discovered that the AT-STs were vulnerable to anti-Gorax traps. Ramming logs could smash through the walker's head, destroying the cockpit. One of its other weaknesses was its susceptibility to hijacking, despite the height of the vehicle seemingly making hijacking an impossibility. A sufficiently strong force could rip the entrance hatch off the top of the walker. If commandeered, the walker's cannons could easily penetrate other AT-STs' armor.</p><h3>Variant models</h3><p><b>AT-ST Mark III</b></p><p>The AT-ST Mark IIIs were equipped with experimental armor that provided more speed and durability than that of the standard AT-ST. Mounted with twin heavy laser cannons and piloted by veteran crews, they excelled against most targets.</p><p><b>AT-ST Raider</b></p><p>A variant used by a Klatooinian tribe.</p><p><b>Cold weather AT-ST Mark III</b></p><p>A variant of the AT-ST Mark III. This variant had its internal systems retrofitted to allow for optimal performance in sub-zero temperatures.</p><p><b>Enhanced AT-ST Walker</b></p><p>The enhanced AT-ST Walkers boasted enhanced power couplings and sub-systems, allowing their weapons to fire high-powered blasts at a faster rate than average.

I guess it wanted to keep us from flanking it's big cousins."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Chanda Bethari's account of fighting an AT-ST on Hoth</span></p></blockquote><p>Part of the All-Terrain walker family, the AT-ST's role in supporting Imperial ground operations earned it the moniker "scout walker" owing to its ability in ferreting out enemy positions and inspecting locations in advance of larger walkers. It was better equipped than the Republic AT-RT.</p><p>The Imperial Military commonly used the AT-ST in a variety of environments. At least one AT-ST was deployed on Jedha in 0 BBY in a battle during the planet's insurgency. The walkers were also used in the Galactic Civil War, and between the Battle of Yavin and Battle of Hoth, the Alliance to Restore the Republic operated stolen AT-STs, and provided them to Saponza's Gang, who often fought against the walkers. Several fought alongside AT-ATs at the Battle of Hoth. They also notably participated in the Battle of Endor, where they were defeated by the Ewoks and their traps. The walkers were also used by the Empire in the final battle of the Galactic Civil War, the Battle of Jakku, which ended up being an overwhelming victory for the New Republic.</p><p>Thirty years after the close of the Galactic Civil War, a splinter military group of the New Republic called the Resistance utilized old Imperial AT-STs in combat against the reorganized remnants of the Galactic Empire, the First Order.

They were well known as galactic gangsters whose Grand Hutt Council controlled the Hutt Clan crime syndicate. One famous Hutt was the crime lord Jabba, who ruled a massive criminal empire from his palace on Tatooine.</p><h3>Biology and appearance</h3><p>Hutts were a massive slug-like species who had large mouths and stubby arms. They had three lungs. They were tough and muscular with thick leathery skin, which was wrinkled and slimy. Hutts often had watery eyes and slack facial expressions. Their tails were supported by a skeletal spine. Despite their legendary adult size, Hutts started out as tiny Huttlets less than half a meter in height.</p><p>Their homeworld of Nal Hutta had a hot atmosphere and was frequently streaked by greasy rains, creating a fetid sauna in which Hutts were most comfortable. Hutts could live for centuriesâ€”Jabba was 604 when he was killedâ€”and could grow to enormous sizes.</p><p>Hutts were not known for being healthy. Some Hutts suffered from a genetic defect that caused their skin to be bereft of pigment and prone to cracking.</p><h3>History</h3><p><b>Preâ€“Clone Wars</b></p><p>For centuries, the Hutts dominated much of the organized criminal activities in the galaxy. They dominated the Twi'leks of Ryloth and the Nikto species for several centuries.</p><p><b>Clone Wars</b></p><p>During the Clone Wars, the Galactic Republic forged a tacit alliance with the crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure after the Jedi Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano rescued his son Rotta. The Republic Senator PadmÃ© Amidala also foiled a plot by Jabba's uncle Ziro to overthrow his nephew with the collusion of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.</p><p><b>Age of the Empire</b></p><p>The Hutts also had extensive dealings with the Galactic Empire and helped run several black-site prisons. During the Age of the Empire, the Hutts and other organized criminal groups exercised a powerful grip on the galaxy. Following the liberation of Akiva, the New Republic took steps to curtail the influence of the Hutts and other organized groups by introducing financial regulations and undertaking comprehensive patrols of the galactic shipping lanes. Still, the Hutts were able to exercise some influence over the Nikto species and their government.</p><p><b>Postâ€“Galactic Civil War</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"The Hutts are in disarray."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Rynscar</span></p></blockquote><p>During the New Republic era, the Hutts lost much of their former power over the galactic underworld and were supplanted by Nikto crime cartels like Rinnrivin Di's cartel. The Hutts were disliked by both the Populists and the Centrists, the two main factions in the New Republic's Galactic Senate. Several Nikto like Rinnrivin admired Leia Organa for her role in killing Jabba and christened her "Huttslayer."</p><h3>Culture</h3><p>Most Hutts were crime lords who lived opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like spice smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting in Hutt Space. They were typically obese, with the muscular Nar Shaddaa kingpin Grakkus being an exception. The Hutt Clan was divided into families known as kajidics: Jabba's family was the Desilijic kajidic, whose sigil was tattooed on his arm. Hutts bandaged and buried their dead.</p><p>Classical architectural Hutt style could be seen on the planet Mataou. It was characterized by terraced buildings with sloping gates, and white and red colors. Clothing was optional for Hutts, and some would use live Sha'rellian toops as hairpieces. Hutts liked to eat gorgs, slime pods and Klatooine paddy frogs, and were known to smoke hookah pipes. The Hutts believed that at least one of their own, Boonta Hestilic Shad'ruu, had ascended to godhood, and held the Boonta Eve holiday in their honor.</p><br><br><br><br><h1>Detention Warden</h1><br><h2>lawful balanced</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"Clear the bridge.

It was created in the wake of the Clone Wars, when Chancellor Sheev Palpatine transformed the Galactic Republic he led into an authoritarian Empire. Consisting mainly of Star Destroyers and TIE fighters, the Imperial Navy was tasked with maintaining order in the galaxy.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>With the rise of the New Order, the massive military buildup that became synonymous with the late Galactic Republic in an effort to combat the Separatist Alliance in the Clone Wars was continued and expanded in the now Galactic Empire. When the Separatist leadership was executed at Mustafar by Darth Vader; then Supreme Chancellor Palpatine announced his plans for the galaxy since the beginning. Officially wiping away the thousand year old Republic by announcing the creation of the Galactic Empire, with himself as Galactic Emperor.</p><p>After the the rise of the New Order, the Imperial Navy was created from the remains of the Republic Navy at the end of the Clone Wars, and inherited its proud naval tradition that dated back thousands of years. It came to have its own starships that patrolled the vast majority of Imperial space throughout the reign of Emperor Palpatine's New Order.</p><p>After the establishment of the Imperial Navy, it became the primary projection of the Imperial Military's arm, becoming the largest branch in the Armed Forces with its enormous fleet of vessels and millions of personnel.</p><h3>History</h3><p><b>Rise of the Imperial Fleet</b></p><p>Almost immediately, any reminders of the Old Republic were removed, with the Grand Army of the Republic renamed the Imperial Army and Republic Navy reorganized as the Imperial Navy. The distinctive red coloring of Venator-class Star Destroyers were almost immediately painted a more subdued grey, along with the eventual uniform and equipment upgrades for the countless men and women in the Imperial Military. In the days following the proclamation of the New Order, the Imperial Navy would continue to utilize the popular Republic-era Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighters along with the mass produced Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter, while Darth Vader would receive his own black Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor until he would eventually pilot his much improved TIE Advanced x1 which first saw usage during the Siege of Lothal four years prior to the Battle of Yavin.</p><p>With the destruction of the planet Anaxes and its shipyard facilities due to a cataclysmic event, corporations such as Sienar Fleet Systems and Kuat Drive Yards took up the mantle of producing the newer Imperial vessels coming into production. The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer would come to represent the new image of Imperial power and would eventually become the most feared and recognizable image of the Empire, with a mere Star Destroyer usually enough to bring treasonous systems in line through sheer threat of force. Due to their impressive armaments and imposing nature, nearly 25,000 Destroyers would be in operation at the height of the Empire's power.</p><p>The Imperial Navy would be occupied in subjugating remaining Separatist holdouts throughout the galaxy for at least five years following at Empire's rise along with cementing its political and territorial stability, allowing a sense of peace and prosperity to return to the Core Worlds. Four years after the Empire's rise, the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Perilous would be dispatched to quell the Free Ryloth movement over the Outer Rim world of Ryloth. However unbeknownst to the Imperials it would also be subject to an elaborate trap set by the rebels, in which it would be the first ISD to be destroyed to Moff Delian Mors knowledge. Nevertheless, the vessel would continue to be one of the most dreaded ships in the Imperial Fleet.</p><p>Five years into Imperial rule, the Imperial Navy began replacing its aging ARC-170 starfighters with the newer TIE Starfighter line, however Republic-era ships and equipment would still be utilized as the newer models were distributed. The Navy would also commission the Carrion Spike as Moff Tarkin's personal corvette, however a rebel cell led by former Republic Intelligence Captain Berch Teller would end up stealing the ship, causing a major political nightmare and military embarrassment for the Empire, with numerous star systems falling victim to the advanced ships weaponry and mechanical systems. The ship was ultimately destroyed after attacking a supply convoy carrying parts for the Empire's rumored Ultimate Weapon, which only later the galaxy would know as the Death Star. The cell along with its collaborators would be captured, interrogated and executed, while the Naval Intelligence Agency created during the rise of the Empire would be folded back under Imperial Intelligence following the discovery that one of its leaders and member of the Joint Chiefs was conspiring with the rebels in hopes of destroying them and thus receiving a promotion. Ultimately, the Empire had successfully dealt with a potentially hazardous situation, all while keeping details of its new superweapon a mere rumor.<br></p><p>Eight years after the formation of the Empire, the Imperial Navy would be engaged in the Gorse conflict which would see the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Ultimatum commanded by Rae Sloane deployed to the Gorse system. With the Empire interested in increasing efficiency in the system due to the rare abundance of Thorilide found within, with Thorilide being a vital part in the construction of turbolaser batteries and thus essential for the expansion of the Imperial Starfleet. A brief encounter with rebels would occur, after which the planet would be secured, and production would be transferred to Baron Lero Danthe. Also around this time, the Empire would begin to utilize Gozanti-class cruisers to transport materials, slaves and other vital resources.</p><p><b>A growing insurrection</b></p><p>Thirteen years into the Empire's reign, an insurgency would tie up Imperial resources over the backwater agricultural world of Lothal, in which a rebel cell would continually harass and destroy Imperial resources. With Sienar Fleet Systems engaged in the lucrative production of TIE fighters for the Empire, along with the production of the new TIE Advanced v1, precursor to the x1, numerous Imperial-class Star Destroyers would be sent into orbit in an effort to capture the rebel group, along with the eventual redeployment of Grand Moff Tarkin to deal with the terrorists a year later. After capturing the Jedi in charge of the cell, Tarkin's new flagship, the Sovereign, would escort the Jedi survivor to Mustafar, where a small rebel fleet would engage it and several other Star Destroyers, destroying the Sovereign in the process but not before Tarkin managed to escape. The destruction of the Sovereign would continue to be remembered years later by soldiers of the New Republic.</p><p>The brutal Siege of Lothal would eventually be ordered by Darth Vader, in which multiple TIE/LN starfighters would scour the planet in an effort to locate the rebels and strike fear into the local population. Eventually forcing the rebels to flee Lothal, while the Imperial Navy would be able to deal a heavy blow to the Phoenix Cell in a pitched space battle. Nonetheless, a growing rebel network would cause worry within the higher echelons of the Empire, and along with it inspiring a greater emphasis on dealing with the growing insurrection.</p><p>Fourteen years after the Empire's political formation, Imperial Interdictor vessels would still be undergoing tests in locations such as the Del Zennis system, with the unique Imperial Interdictor improving on the design flaws of its predecessors roughly a decade ago. As a result, specialized test zones would be erected to test the ships capabilities, while Imperial weapons technicians would wear a specialized gold-colored uniform variant denoting the uniqueness of the project.</p><p>Nineteen years after the founding of the Galactic Empire, the Death Star would be ready for usage after its lengthy construction, demonstrating its firepower on the populous world of Alderaan in an effort to persuade then captive Princess Leia Organa to reveal the presence of a rebel base for the recently formed Alliance to Restore the Republic, following capture aboard her CR90 corvette the Tantive IV over Tatooine by the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Devastator, which also served as Lord Vader's personal flagship. In an instant, the influential world was destroyed, however an unlikely band of rebels, along with an older Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi managed to free the princess and escape to the Alliance's base on Yavin 4. Unbeknownst to the rebels, a homing beacon had been installed on their ship, the Corellian YT-1300 light freighter Millennium Falcon leading the Death Star to the planet. During the intense Battle of Yavin, Luke Skywalker managed to fire the shot that would ultimately destroy the Empire's dreaded battlestation.</p><p><b>The Galactic Civil War</b></p><p>Following the destruction of the first Death Star, the Empire immediately began construction on the newer and more powerful DS-2 Death Star, all while the Imperial Military reeled at the loss of such a sizable portion of its martial forces. With nearly all of the Joint Chiefs of the Empire located on the battlestation when it was destroyed, General Cassio Tagge was promoted to the newly created rank of Grand General, receiving command of nearly all Imperial Military resources, while junior officers were quickly promoted in order to fill in the positions of the newly deceased. Simultaneously, Admiral Kendal Ozzel would personally issue a communique ordering the fleet into battle readiness. The Imperial Military also underwent a mass reorganization, rescinding the classification of Imperial Navy and Imperial Army pilots and engaging in rushed and scrambled offenses often with low quality intelligence in an effort to keep the rebels off balance.</p><p>Mobilizing for a galactic war, the Imperial fleet also began occupying notorious spice worlds such as Kerev Doi in an attempt to cut off potential sources of income for the Rebel Alliance. In a rapid blow and taking advantage of the Imperial Navy'sâ€”and Empire's temporary vertiginous state, the Rebel Alliance managed to destroy Weapons Factory Alpha located in the Corellian Industrial Cluster on Cymoon 1, the largest weapons factory in the galaxy and essential for Imperial Military production. Bombing the Imperial shipyards at Kuat and a supply base at Imdaar, the Rebellion also launched a series of over a dozen attacks against Imperial forces scattered across the galaxy. As a result, the Empire would be forced to deal with the Hutt Cartel in order to procure the necessary resources to rebuild from such a military setback. Grand General Tagge also noted how increased pirate attacks against Imperial convoys was only natural considering the loss of such a symbol of Imperial power.</p><p>Nonetheless the Empire's resolve would only increase in its pursuit of the rebel fleet, in which an elaborate scheme was put in motion attempting to sway the genius Drusil Bephorin to their cause who could reputedly discover the fleet through advanced mathematics. After a daring rescue led by then-Lieutenant Luke Skywalker, Drusil managed to escape her captivity on Denon as well as multiple Star Destroyers in pursuit. Also successfully eluding numerous Immobilizer 418 cruisers attempting to draw them out of hyperspace, she and her family safely arrived on the ocean world of Omereth. With the rescue of Drusil to the Alliance's cause, the Empire would suffer a decisive defeat, all while giving the Rebellion an edge in its fight against the New Order.</p><p>In the three years before the Battle of Hoth, the Empire would send numerous Viper probe droids to scour the galaxy for any hint of the rebel fleet, and later the presumed rebel base of operations. After a lone probe managed to discover the rebels at Echo Base on the remote ice world of Hoth, the Empire would assault the system under the newly formed Death Squadron, lead by no other Darth Vader himself aboard his new flagship the Executor-class Star Dreadnought, Executor. Seeking to surprise the rebels, Admiral Kendal Ozzel entered the system near the planet, alerting the Alliance to their presence and thus allowing them to raise their defensive shields, forcing a ground-based assault to ensue rather than an orbital bombardment. Choked by Vader for his arrogance, he installed Captain Firmus Piett in command of the Executor, all while the massive Battle of Hoth would ensue on the planet's surface. With Death Squadron in orbit, escaping transports were shot down and destroyed, with Admiral Jhared Montferrat taking down the transport that carried the wife of young rebel Adon Fox. However, the planetary v-150 ion cannon managed to temporarily disable various Imperial-class Star Destroyers, allowing numerous rebel sympathizers to escape.</p><p>Seeking to end the rebellion once and for all, a mere year later Emperor Palpatine opted to leak just enough information to the Bothan spynet and thus the Rebel Alliance that a new, more powerful Death Star was in construction over the forest moon of Endor, and that he himself would be overseeing its final stages of construction personally. Tempted, the Rebel Alliance began massing its fleet in the Sullust system, in which the Emperor ordered the Imperial Navy to ignore, hoping for the rebels to commit all their forces to a doomed attack. In preparation, Imperial naval resources gathered for the encounter in the Hudalla system.</p><p>Later arriving in the Endor system, the rebel fleet was surrounded by the single largest gathering of Star Destroyers in Imperial history, as well as a fully armed and operational Death Star, contradictory to the information that had been given to them. The Emperor however, seeking to turn a captive Luke Skywalker to the Dark side of the Force decreed that only the fighters engage the rebel fleet in an effort to prolong the encounter and thus enrage Skywalker. Unfortunately for the Emperor, not only would Luke Skywalker refuse the offer and become a Jedi Knight in his own regard, but the rebel strike team sent to disable the Death Star's shield generator on Endor would succeed, allowing the rebels to enter the unfinished Death Star II and destroy its main reactor. With the death of the Emperor by the hands of his own apprentice, the Galactic Empire and thus the Imperial Military would be thrown into a state of disarray following the loss of their leadership. The Battle of Endor had ended a clear defeat for both the Empire and Imperial Navy.</p><p><b>Post-Endor Conflicts</b></p><p><u>Imperial fragmentation</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"Portions of our naval fleet have been hidden since not long after the destruction of our glorious battle station over the Endor moon. These fleets are not as large as the one we currently control here in the Vulpinus. Yet there are substantially just the same: hundreds of Star Destroyers, thousands of smaller craft."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax</span></p></blockquote><p>The Empire immediately entered a state of chaos after the death of its Galactic Emperor, with civil unrest across the galaxy and numerous individuals claiming to be be the rightful heir to the throne. Nonetheless, Imperial records would be in shambles for months in an attempt to confirm the deaths of personnel lost aboard the second Death Star, all while combating the new threat of the New Republic. Hearing of the Emperor's defeat at Endor, Governor Ubrik Adelhard would lock down the Anoat sector to all traffic, creating what would come to be known as the Iron Blockade. Subsequently numerous splinter fleets would separate from the Imperial Navy, while infighting and betrayal would spill blood in what the Imperial HoloNet would deem skirmishes and mutinies, all the while the full-scale galactic war that began following the Battle of Hoth would continue with increased ferocity. The Imperial Navy would also encounter fuel shortages, as Republic attacks forced Imperial vessels to flee, thus burning more fuel than what could be supplied.</p><p>After the death of the Emperor, Sentinel droids were sent to "selected" Imperial officers. These officers included Admiral Garrick Versio,[49] and Captain Lerr Duvat. They were ordered to begin Operation: Cinder, and emergency directive to tear apart the Empire. This could be done by experimental weather arrays.</p><p>In an effort to re-organize a fractured Empire, a secret Imperial gathering over the Outer Rim world of Akiva would commence in the months after the Battle of Endor, called the Imperial Future Council. Unfortunately, the meeting failed after the New Republic received word of the gathering and arrived en masse in the system, forcing a major space battle to ensue. The Republic had received information about the conference from a mysterious source known as the Operator, who was actually the Imperial Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax. Rax supplied information to the New Republic in order to eliminate his political rivals. Admiral Rae Sloane survived the battle and reunited with the Fleet Admiral in the Vulpinus Nebula.</p><p>The fragmentation of the Imperial war machine would also hamper Imperial Military production in the months after the Battle of Endor, creating a supply shortage of TIE/LN starfighters and forcing Star Destroyers to head out with less craft. Lack of trained personnel also harrowed the Imperial Navy, while the once mighty fleet was reduced to a single Super Star Destroyer, the Ravager. Following the events on Akiva, Rae Sloane became Grand Admiral and assumed leadership of Imperial forces in the Vulpinus Nebula; the largest of the Imperial remnant forces. In secret, Fleet Admiral Rax ruled the Imperial forces from behind the scenes. Sloane later discovered evidence that at least a quarter of the Empire's Star Destroyers and the Emperor's Super Star Destroyer Eclipse had mysteriously disappeared instead of being destroyed in battles with the New Republic as reported in the Imperial records.</p><p>During the inaugural meeting of the Shadow Council, Rax revealed that he secretly commanded substantial Imperial fleets consisting of hundreds of Star Destroyers and thousands of smaller craft in the Almagest, the Recluse's Nebula, the Queluhan Nebula, the Ro-Loo Triangle, and the Inamorata. Rax also used the Imperial-held foundry worlds of Zhadalene, Korrus, and Belladoon to produced war material including new TIE fighters for the Imperial war effort. Following the loss of Kashyyyk and the attack on the New Republic capital of Chandrila, Rax took power as Counselor to the Empire. To test the mettle of his new armada against the New Republic, Rax ordered the Imperial fleets to assemble on the planet Jakku.</p><p><b>Showdown on Jakku</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"I must be a stronger blade! A... a blade with which to slit the throats of the traitors that crawl on their bellies toward our door!"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Captain Groff, before his death during the Battle of Jakku</span></p></blockquote><p>After the discovery of Imperial forces at Jakku, the New Republic dispatched forces to take on the Empire following a Galactic Senate vote. A year and four days after the Battle of Endor, the Galactic Empire would be engaged in a major land and space battle over the desert world of Jakku against the New Republic. While Rax went to prepare the next stage of the Emperor's posthumous Contingency plan (which involved blowing up the planet Jakku while he and a chosen elect fled into the Unknown Regions), Grand Moff Randd commanded the Imperial fleet from the Ravager.</p><p>During the battle, the Imperial Navy formed a tight, protective wall around the Super Star Destroyer Ravager. This blunted the New Republic assault. As the battle raged, Captain Groff of the Star Destroyer Punishment panicked and rammed his Star Destroyer into a New Republic ship. This allowed the New Republic Commodore Kyrsta Agate to find a gap and bombard the Ravager. The Super Star Destroyer quickly crippled Agate's Starhawk-class battleship Concord but Agate managed to trap the Ravager in her ship's tractor beam. The downing of the Ravager turned the tide of the battle in the New Republic's favor. The ship's commanding officer Randd abandoned his post and fled in an escape pod.</p><p>With the growing New Republic Defense Fleet needing ships to supplement its military forces, it also embarked on a campaign to board and capture Imperial vessels during the battle. Lieutenant Thane Kyrell led a New Republic boarding party which boarded the Imperial-class Star Destroyer Inflictor in an effort to capture its first Star Destroyer. The attempt ultimately failed when Captain Ciena Ree crashed it onto the planet's surface below. Meanwhile, Grand Admiral Sloane joined forces with her New Republic opponents Norra Wexley and Brentin Lore Wexley to stop Counselor Rax from detonating Jakku and destroying the Imperial and New Republic forces.</p><p>Amidst the loss of the Ravager and the death of Gallius Rax, Grand Vizier Mas Amedda signed the Galactic Concordance with the New Republic; formally ending the Galactic Civil War and facilitating the Empire's surrender to the Republic. Per the terms of the Empire's surrender, the Imperial government was dissolved and all surviving Imperial military officers were designated as war criminals. Despite the Empire's surrender, several Imperial captains continued fighting at Jakku. Some crashed their ships onto the surface and tried to drag their enemies with them. Other Imperial captains fled with their warships into the Unknown Regions, using secret coordinates that had been supplied as part of the Contingency. Meanwhile, Grand Admiral Sloane, the highest ranking officer in the Imperial Navy, along with Brendol Hux, his son Armitage Hux, and several child soldiers rendezvoused in the Unknown Regions with the Emperor's command ship Eclipse, which had been sent into the frontier in advance as part of the Contingency.</p><p><b>Defeat and rebirth</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"You will be avengedâ€”when the Empire rises again."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Nash Windrider</span></p></blockquote><p>The Battle of Jakku was a catastrophic defeat for the Empire which turned the tide of the war decisively in the New Republic's favor. With few Star Destroyers left, the severely depleted Imperial fleet was confined to pre-determined regions within the Core Worlds and the Inner Rim. With talk that the Empire would be forced to engage in diplomatic talks with the New Republic in the month following the Battle of Jakku, many believed its collapse and ultimate surrender was imminent. Unbeknownst to the rebels, Imperial forces under Grand Moff Randd and Commander Nash Windrider had secretly used the time to amass its ships in the Queluhan Nebula, which masked it from enemy sensors in an endeavor to assault the Republic once again. With a clear chain of command reestablished and the factionalism that had previously divided the Empire swept awayâ€”along with weapons upgrades to its TIE/LN starfighters, the Imperial Navy stood ready to strike again.</p><p>Ultimately, the remnants of the Empire were defeated by the New Republic. Under the terms of the Galactic Concordance, the former Empire was forced to disarm its military forces and to pay punishing war reparations. A group of Imperial hardliners as per the Contingency relocated to the Unknown Regions where they remained for the next three decades. During that time, they re-consolidated themselves as the First Order, a military junta that admired the New Order and sought to "restore it" to the Galaxy. In 28 ABY, an individual at a cantina on Pamarthe stated that they thought the Imperial fleet still existed and would strike again.</p><p>In 21 ABY, the First Order embarked on an expansion of the old Imperial fleet, which had reinvented itself as the First Order Navy. To fund this rearmament program, the First Order channeled considerable funds into sympathetic Centrist senators in the New Republic like Lady Carise Sindian. Lady Carise used these funds to arm and train the Amaxine warriors, a paramilitary group led by Imperial loyalists including Arliz Hadrassian. To hide these funds, the First Order and their Centrist collaborators bankrolled the Nikto crime lord Rinnrivin Di's cartel. The profits from Rinnrivin's cartel were channeled back to shadow corporations in the Outer Rim run by Centrists, who transferred the funds back to the First Order. Despite an investigation launched by Senators Leia Organa and Ransolm Casterfo which neutralized Rinnrivin and the Amaxines, the First Order Navy succeeded in rebuilding its fleet by the time of the Cold war.</p><h3>Organization</h3><p><b>Administration</b></p><p>The Imperial Navy was commanded by Galactic Emperor Palpatine and the Joint Chiefs of the Empire, while admirals and captains assumed responsibility for their respective craft and would be informed of any long-term plans. The Admiralty was the overall leading unit of the navy and included Imperial Navy High Command. Naval Command and Control and the Naval chiefs also oversaw the tactical strategy of the Navy, and reassigned ships to trouble spots and plotted long-term strategy under the oversight of both the Emperor and Joint Chiefs. The Imperial Starfighter Corps also aided in overall naval operations, and disliked the Admiralty's push towards Kuat Drive Yards near monopoly on capital ship production due to a belief that TIE/LN fighters were purposely weakened to ensure continued production and purchases from the company would continue.</p><p>Similar to the Army, the Imperial Navy contained multiple branches responsible for various aspects of naval warfare, of which the most important and well known was Fleet Command. Fleet Command controlled the Imperial Navy's sub-capital and capital ships, and the lowest recruits to the Admiral of the Fleet fell under its auspices.</p><p>It was highly unusual for officers to receive captaincy of a Star Destroyer until middle age, while being assigned captaincy of smaller craft was considered to be ignominious. It was common practice for the Imperial Starfleet to often amass ships in an attempt to intimidate various worlds, officers sometimes gathered their respective ships in an attempt to display their power and impress superiors, with the more ships and men under ones command the more important that person was considered. With the Emperor commanding the most ships and men, he was easily considered the most important. The Navy also worked in conjunction with the Imperial Security Bureau, who installed an internal affairs officer aboard every Imperial-class Star Destroyer and Executor-class Star Dreadnought, while the Naval Intelligence Agency and its oversight by Imperial Intelligence provided vital information for the armada.</p><p><b>Order of Battle</b></p><p>In order to patrol the vast expanses of Imperial space, the Empire would split up varying amounts of naval forces into fleets, commanded by an admiral, a Fleet Admiral, or a Grand Admiral. Sector fleets controlled specific sectors of the galaxy, such as the Lothal sector fleet and the Anoat sector fleet. However, other fleets were mobile, being sent to conflicts where they were needed. These types of fleet included the Third Fleet, Seventh Fleet, Eleventh Fleet, and Death Squadron.</p><p>These fleets typically contained half a dozen Star Destroyers as their backbone, and were augmented by various carriers, starfighters, transports, gunboats and other support craft. Specific composition and size of a fleet varied dramatically on the fleet's mission and the political power of its commander.</p><p>Task forces were units of ships smaller than fleets that were usually under the command of an commodore or admiral whose flagship was an Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Notable task forces included the 96th, the 103rd, the 125th, the 231st and Carlou Gendling's task force.</p><p>By the height of the Galactic Empire, approximately 25,000 Imperial-class Star Destroyers would have been in use, while 20% of the Empire's starfighter fleet would be made up of the TIE/IN interceptor and other newer models in direct response to the Alliance's faster vessels such as the RZ-1 A-wing interceptor coming into production.</p><h3><b>Personnel</b></h3><blockquote><p><i>"Ships, like men, must be used until they break."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Governor Everi Chalis</span></p></blockquote><p><b>Specializations</b></p><p>While the Imperial Navy was known mostly for its imposing dagger-shaped ships, Imperial manpower was also vital for the utilization of those craft. Dividing its personnel into the classification of either officer or enlisted, officers often received extra pay and visitation rights to their families more than once every five years for those from the Core Worlds, who often limited their communication to and from their families to demonstrate their commitment to the cause. Officers were encouraged to drink a nutritive slurry instead of regular food in order to conserve resources, however senior officers could gorge themselves without appearing feeble, and commissaries on various Imperial stations often served exotic foods, albeit for a stiff price. All officers and stormtroopers were required to have an innate combat readiness, and were expected to pass repeated certifications in various forms of self defense, weapon and vehicle handling, however at higher ranks these requirements lessened somewhat. Gambling was expressly forbidden within the military, with harsh punishments for those engaging in the activity. Those that shirked from duty could be reported for cowardice.</p><p>The enlisted ranks comprised the bulk of Imperial manpower, often filling in vital roles in maintaining, operating and providing assistance to the Imperial fleet with positions such as Imperial Navy Troopers (including their Death Star counterparts), flight commanders, duty officers and technicians. While only ten percent of TIE pilots graduated from the Imperial pilot training program, all pilots were still expected to be able to maintain and repair all single- and dual-pilot craft, and would often fly low over areas that needed to be reminded of the Empire's strength.</p><p>Crewmen often worked in sunken data pitsâ€”which denoted command hierarchyâ€”located on the bridges of capital ships, and oversaw all data and intelligence transfer throughout the entire vessel, and could provide auxiliary navigational assistance to other craft in the system. While not all Imperial facilities utilized sunken data pits, Wilhuff Tarkin preferred their design and had them installed at the prefabricated Imperial facility known as Sentinel Base. Imperial weapons technicians operated the turbolaser batteries on various Imperial craft, while their elite gunners manned the Death Star's superlaser.</p><p>Handling logistical operations on Imperial Navy vessels were fleet logistics liaisons from the logistics corps.</p><p>There existed a form of rivalry between the Navy and the Imperial Army, with some naval officers having accused their colleagues of being pompous, unimaginative and arrogant. A rivalry also existed between Imperial Army and Imperial Navy pilots due to the latter often receiving better public recognition through the HoloNet News.</p><p>The Imperial MSE-6 series repair droid was utilized in most Imperial vessels to clean the floors.</p><p><b>Training</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"You, too, can be part of the Imperial family. Don't just dream about applying for the Academy, make it come true! You can find a career in space: Exploration, Starfleet, or Merchant Service. Choose from navigation, engineering, space medicine, contact/liaison, and more! If you have the right stuff to take on the universe, and standardized examination scores that meet the requirements, dispatch your application to the Academy Screening Office, care of the Commandant, and join the ranks of the proud!"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Advertisement promoting the Imperial Academy</span></p></blockquote><p>With many attracted to the Imperial Navy by promises of decent pay and access to some of the most advanced ships in the galaxy, prospective Imperial cadets could attend a preparatory school on respective worlds such as at the Academy for Young Imperials on Lothal, and from there would be sorted into advanced Imperial academies for further training. Not all candidates continued on with their training however, with some returning to their previous lives or failing to meet requirements. Most slots in the Inner Rim were reserved for citizens of former Separatist worlds in an effort to increase their loyalty.</p><p>After completion of their preparatory school, trainees would then be sorted alphabetically into their future academy, such as at the Arkanis Academy, with the most prestigious being the Royal Imperial Academy on Coruscant. Imperial officer training was noted to be vigorous, with frequent inspections and topics such as Core Worlds Classical Culture, Security Protocols and Interrogation Techniques, Large Vessel Design, Amphibious Battle Tactics and Large Vessel Design, along with training in numerous flight simulators. Imperial TIE pilots were trained that aiding fellow fliers was low priority unless no other task was assigned. Additionally, recruits could participate in athletic activities and compete professionally in Naval Corps Boxing, all for the chance of winning the belt. Cadets were ultimately separated into various tracks such as the command track or elite flight, while at the Royal Academy top cadets could attend a reception and ball at the Imperial Palace along with hundreds of senior military and government officials.</p><p>Upon graduation, trainees were commissioned as lieutenants, while they were also allowed a postgraduate visit back to their homeworlds. Further into their military careers, it was frowned upon to take recreational time off, while the vast majority of Imperial officers remained in service until they hit the mandatory retirement age or died. The Medal of Honor was one of the highest forms of Imperial commendation, lower only to the prestigious Distinguished Medal of Imperial Honor, given only for the greatest acts of sacrifice.</p><p><b>Ranks</b></p><p>Rank was determined by wearing a color-coded rank insignia plaque which utilized red, blue and yellow squares. An admiral was identified by twelve multicolored squares, six red over six blue; however, black-uniformed officers were identified with six colored squares side by side for the rank of admiral, four red and two yellow along with red-tipped code cylinders, unlike the blue tipped variant used by other officers. A captain was identified by six squares of three red over three blue. The prestigious title of Grand Moff was identified with twelve squares, six blue over three red and three yellow. While most high-ranking officers wore olive-green drab and lower ranking noncoms wore black uniforms, some officers could rise up the ranks and keep their black uniform variant.</p><p>The ranks of the Imperial Navy, arranged from lowest to highest, were: Ensign, Lieutenant (subdivided into Junior and Senior Lieutenant), Captain, Lieutenant Commander, Commander, Commodore, Rear Admiral, Vice Admiral, Admiral, Fleet Admiral, Grand Admiral, and Admiral of the Fleet. The Chief of the Imperial Navy was a single individual who served on the Joint Chiefs and advised the Supreme Commander of the overall Imperial Military.</p><p>A Flag Captain referred to a high-ranking individual who captained the flagship of an admiral. A Flag officer referred to a senior officer above the rank of commander.</p><p>It typically took ten to fifteen years to transition from ensign fresh from the academy to captain. Usually, a captain waited at least six more years before becoming commander. However, the High Command could speed up the process, especially for political reasons.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Imperial uniforms varied depending on the specialization of the individual, ranging from protective armor to pressed jackets. Those of higher rank often wore the distinctive olive-green double-breasted tunic along with boots, trousers and a command cap displaying an officer's disk designed by Tarkin himself following the rise of the New Order. It saw wide service in both the Imperial Navy and Army, however a black variant was utilized by noncoms and stormtrooper officers.</p><p>Imperial weapons technicians wore distinctive clamshell helmets and partial body armor, while TIE pilots wore encased full body armor with helmets similar to those worn by stormtroopers, along with with flexible gas transfer tubes in the front of their helmets along with other modifications for operating in the vacuum of space.</p><h3><b>Starships of the Imperial Navy</b></h3><p><b>Capital ships</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"We will apprehend them, my lord. Even if that requires repositioning half the capital ships in the fleet."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Vice Admiral Dodd Rancit, to Emperor Palpatine</span></p></blockquote><p>During its reign of the galaxy, the Imperial Navy used a plethora of capital ships as flagships and command ships. Several varieties of Star Destroyer were used, including the common Imperial-class Star Destroyers which consisted of both Imperial I- and Imperial II-class Star Destroyers, as well as the Interdictor-class Star Destroyer, the qaz-class Star Destroyer, the Secutor-class Star Destroyer, the Tector-class Star Destroyer, the Venator-class Star Destroyer, the Victory-class Star Destroyer, the Gladiator-class Star Destroyer, and the Onager-class Star Destroyer.</p><p>Although a rarer sight than a Star Destroyer, dreadnoughts were even more formidable ships. Thirteen Super Star Destroyers were in Imperial service prior to the Battle of Endor, including several Executor-class Star Dreadnoughts which consisted of the Executor I-class Star Dreadnought and the Executor II-class Star Dreadnought. The Assertor-class Command Dreadnought, acted as a sector command ship, and a heavy weapons platform. The Asteroid Dreadnought was rumoured to be in the Navy's possession.</p><p><b>Smaller craft</b></p><p>Along with its massive capital ships, the Imperial Navy also employed smaller vessels for support or other purposes not fit for a Star Destroyer. These included cruisers, such as attack cruisers, bulk cruisers, battlecruisers, Detainer CC-2200s, Gozanti-class cruisers, IGV-55 surveillance vessels, Immobilizer 418 cruisers, Cantwell-class Arrestor Cruisers, Carrack-class light cruisers, and both Arquitens-class command cruisers and light cruisers. A modified variant of the Arquitens-class command cruiser was the prison-tug, which served as a cruiser and tug for wreckage-prisons. A tractor tug was a model of tug utilized by the Empire.</p><p>Carriers were also widely used. Notable Imperial carrier ships included the Gozanti-class Assault Carrier, the Imperial escort carrier, and Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier which consisted of both the Quasar Fire I-class and the Quasar Fire II-class cruiser-carrier.</p><p>Corvettes such as the CR90 corvette and the Raider II-class corvette were also utilized.</p><p>Notable frigates used included CC-7700 frigates, EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigates and Razor-class frigates.</p><p>Other vessels in this category included the Imperial Support Vessel.</p><p><b>Freighters and cargo transports</b></p><p>To move large amounts of materials across the galaxy, the Imperial Navy used freighters and similar vessels. Common freighters and barges included the class four container transport, the Eta-class supply barge and the Imperial heavy freighter.</p><p><b>Troop and vehicle transports</b></p><p>Small craft dedicated to deploying troops and ground vehicles were known as dropships. Known dropships included the Theta-class barge, the Y-45 armored transport hauler and the Y-85 Titan dropship.</p><p>The type of transport called the Imperial Dropship Transport also performed this role, as did smaller gunships like the Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry and the LAAT/le gunship.</p><p><b>Shuttles</b></p><p>Used to ferry around Imperial personnel, common shuttles included the Lambda-class T-4a shuttle and Delta-class T-3c shuttles of the Abecederian line, as well as Sentinel-class landing crafts, Theta-class T-2c shuttles, Zeta-class cargo shuttles and Zeta-class shuttles. The TIE/sh shuttles and TIE Boarding Crafts from the TIE line were also used as shuttles.</p><p><b>Starfighters</b></p><p>Belonging to the Imperial Navy's own Imperial Starfighter Corps, notable starfighters included the Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighters, Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighters and Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptors. These were, however, later replaced with new TIE line starfighters, such as the TIE/D Defender (and its elite variant), the TIE/IN interceptor, the common TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, the TIE/rb heavy starfighter, the TIE/sa bomber, the TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighter, the TIE/rp Reaper attack lander, the TIE Advanced v1, the TIE Advanced x1, the TIE/ag "Aggressor" Starfighter, the TIE/ca "Punisher" Starfighter, and the TIE lander. The TIE/ph "Phantom" Multi-Role Stealth Starfighter, was equipped with a cloaking device. Outside the TIE line was the prestigious VT-49 Decimator.</p><p><b>Space stations</b></p><p>Imperial construction modules, were used as staging areas, and for construction. The first and second Death Stars were battle stations within the Imperial fleet. The Wrath was a space station that orbited the planet Ponemah Terminal. The Torpedo Sphere that was rumored to be in the Empire's possession was classified as a space station and siege platform. The Shield Gate, orbiting Scarif, protected the Imperial security complex. Hivebase-1 was a top-secret space station used by the Tarkin Initiative as an archive station, it was one of the largest archives ever built. The supertanker fuel depots were mobile space stations designed by the Empire. For planetary defense included the FireStar II-class Orbital Defense Platforms, and the Golan I Space Defense Platforms, these include its other variants. Harbor-class Mobile Space Docks acted as mobile repair yards for Imperial fleets and battlegroups. Mk IX Orbital Maintenance Depots, were massive shipyards that could provide service to dreadnoughts.<br></p><br><br><br><br><h1>Officer, Junior</h1><br><h2>Unaligned</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"Clear the bridge.

It was the successor of the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer that also saw use during the Clone Wars, although it constituted a far more imposing example of walker technology. Heavily armored and awe-inducing, the AT-AT positioned itself as the standard of Imperial firepower on the battlefield.</p><p>In 14 BBY, the Jedi Padawan Cal Kestis hijacked one AT-AT on the planet Kashyyyk.</p><p>In 4 BBY, the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus led three early AT-AT walkers on an assault on the desert planet of Seelos against the Spectres and three retired clone officers aboard an AT-TE.</p><p>AT-ATs were used again in 3 BBY against the Spectres, when Princess Leia Organa arrived on the planet to give the Ghost's crew three Sphyrna-class corvettes. Two walkers were deployed to patrol the transports' landing platform, which were formally on Lothal to offer supplies to citizens impacted by the rebel efforts. When the rebels tried to steal the corvettes, the Ghost started firing on the AT-ATs. Four proton torpedos were not powerful enough to destroy one of the walkers, and it was necessary for Kanan Jarrus to use his lightsaber to cut its legs, toppling it. The second one was knocked down by the engines of the last Hammerhead, piloted by Ryder Azadi.<br></p><p>In 2 BBY, Lieutenant Yogar Lyste deployed two AT-AT walkers, Walker 271 and Walker 414, to combat an attack on the east gate of the Imperial Armory Complex by members of the Lothal resistance led by Ryzder Azadi. The rebels Kanan, Ezra Bridger, and Chopper escaped in the stolen AT-DP Walker 216. However, Grand Admiral Thrawn realized that the rebels had hijacked the AT-DP walker and ordered his AT-ATs to crush them. One of the AT-AT walkers proceeded to crush the AT-DP under its heavy body but the rebels managed to use their lightsabers to cut their way aboard. Morad Sumar also fired a rocket which hit one of the walker's legs. After knocking out the AT-AT pilots, the two climbed out and escaped with Ryder's cell into the wilderness.<br></p><p>Thrawn then deployed four of these during the battle on Atollon.

They used the walker to escape from the factory after they sabotaged its main power core to explode. During their escape, Solo fired a shot that nearly killed the Sith Lord Darth Vader, using the AT-AT's powerful quad laser cannons. Soon after, Vader managed to overtake the Rebels in their escape and cut down the massive walker's back left leg. The AT-AT fell tremendously and its passengers barely escaped the wreckage before fleeing Cymoon 1 entirely for the safety of the Alliance Fleet.<br></p><p><b>Battle of Hoth<br></b></p><p>During the Battle of Hoth, General Maximillian Veers led a squadron of at least five AT-ATs on the icy fields of Hoth to knock out the shield generator that protected Echo Base, the Rebel headquarters. The triumph of Veers' squadron allowed the Imperials to invade Echo Base and rout the Rebels, striking a major blow in the war. However, the battle also revealed that the AT-ATs could be toppled by a cable wrapped around their legs. Although that weakness had been used effectively by the Alliance on Hoth, the Empire continued to use these mechanical behemoths in the later stages of the war, and at least 1 was present on Endor prior to the Battle of Endor.<br></p><p>Shortly after the battle of Endor, the rogue agents of Inferno Squad Iden Versio and Del Meeko used an AT-AT in order to escape Vardos, during Operation: Cinder. In 5 ABY, at least one AT-AT walker was stationed at Camp Sardo on the planet Kashyyyk. During the Liberation of Kashyyyk, several Wookiee guerrilla fighters, including Kirratha, hijacked the AT-AT walker and threw out the crew.

A combination of excellent design, high-quality marketing, and good timing made this astromech droid one of the most sought after droids in history, and one of the few vintage astromech series still in active production decades after it was first designed, including the prototype R2-0. The line was so successful, even being given a positive review by Mechtech Illustrated for its versatility, that the Galactic Empire would later take credit for the design. The average cost for an R2 unit was about 4245 Republic Credits.</p><h3>Functions</h3><p>Like its forerunners, the R2 astromech was designed to work in and around space vessels as a diagnostic and repair unit. But unlike the clunky R1-series, this rounded, waist-high droid was made specifically to fit in military starfighter astromech slots. This was a radical departure, as previously all such droids had been dedicated government models. The droid was equally popular with Galactic Republic fighter jocks as it was with the general public.</p><p>When plugged into a T-65 X-wing starfighter, Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, or similar starfighter, the R2 monitored flight performance, pinpointed and corrected technical problems, and performed power management, optimizing shipboard systems. Its ROM library had reference and repair designs for well over seven hundred starship models to ensure it was able to do its functions in repairwork, with its Intellex IV internal computer scans technical files also co pinpointing potential problems as well as finding data patterns or debug computer codes, allowing it to conduct over 10,000 MPF operations a second. The unit could store up to ten sets of hyperspace vector coordinates in the RAM of its astrogation buffer (thus allowing for even ships with limited navicomputers to make hyperspace jumps and also acting as a backup in the event of navicomputer malfunctions), and many had the intelligence and experience to perform engine startup and pre-flight taxiing. The R2 operated flawlessly in the vacuum of interstellar space. R2 units were equipped with a holographic recording mode.</p><h3>Components</h3><p>The center of the droids' success could be attributed to its Intellex IV computer, which featured at least 700 different spacecraft configurations and could do over 10000 MPF operations every second. Likewise, its built-in telecom software also allowed it to communicate with computers under the jurisdiction of both the Imperial Navy Transmission and the Corporate Sector Standard communications systems, as well as being given custom communications software. Its sensor package was equally impressive, with a full-spectrum transceiver and electromagnetic, heat, motion, and life form indicators. The droid also had a fully maneuverable video sensor, deployed from its domed head, allowing it to inspect enclosed spaces or peer over obstacles. The line also possessed a retractable jack that allowed the unit to plug directly into Imperial-standard computer ports, thus allowing it a direct hard-wired connection to most computers. It also had a flexible video sensor unit that allowed the R2 unit to examine hard-to-see workspaces via a 360-degree rotational joint, with a maximum reach of .85 meters. Aside from its video sensors, the R2-line also had a wide sensor array for almost any purpose, including a full spectrum transceiver, electrophoto receptors, DERs and heat and motion detectors, all of which are routed to the R2's Intellex IV internal computer that supported sophisticated analysis programs including life-form identification subroutines.</p><p>The droid's outer shell concealed an array of tools beneath its streamlined durasteel exterior. Each R2 came equipped from the factory with two manipulator arms (a heavy duty grasper with 25 kilo lifting capacity and 10 kilo grasping measure as well as a fine manipulator with 2 kilo lifting capacity with three 360-degree rotational joints for complete maneuverability and micro-adjustment controls that allowed for better than one micrometer placement accuracy; both manipulators have a .85 meter reach and are fully retractable within the body when not in use[1]), an electric arc welder, circular saw, computer scomp link arm, VicksVisc holographic recorder/projector unit, internal cargo compartment, and a general-use fire extinguisher, all of which came at no extra cost if purchased with the R2 unit. IA, taking a page from Corellian ship-builders, made the droids easy to upgrade and modify. The company offered a variety of after-market packages, but industrious owners also managed to equip R2s with such eclectic items and accessories as underwater propellers, laser pointers, jet thrusters, remote sensor limpets, and inflatable life rafts. This adaptability made the R2 units particularly popular among tech-heads, who often would have running competitions over who could outfit the most eclectic droid.</p><p>IA spent a great deal of time in the design of the R2's personality matrix. The droid was obliging, quick witted, and sincere. If the droid was not subjected to periodic memory wipes, it could develop a headstrong, self-reliant disposition. Many owners, however, actually preferred a droid willing to offer candid second opinions. Starfighter pilots tended to develop a strong bond with their astromech droids, often flying all their missions with one particular droid, and strongly objected to the memory wipes their counterparts were given on a regular basis in some units.</p><p>At least by the time of the Galactic Civil War, R2 purchases came with a three-year warranty, a user-support hotline, IA quality, various affordable prices, and dealer financing.</p><h3>R2-D2</h3><blockquote><p><i>"An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Captain Quarsh Panaka to Queen Amidala</span></p></blockquote><p>The most notable R2-series astromech droid was R2-D2. He participated in numerous battles during both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. It was R2 who helped deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebellion, allowing their victory at the Battle of Yavin, and a message from Princess Leia to Obi-Wan Kenobi, which caused Luke Skywalker to leave Tatooine and go on to become a Jedi Knight.</p><p>Ever since the droid came to the public's attention shortly after the destruction of the first Death Star, despite having played a major part in many previous events, sales showed their highest increase since the launch of the series. IA resisted the urge to feature R2-D2's heroics in its HoloNet advertisements released after the fall of the Galactic Empire for fear of alienating New Republic leaders.</p><br><br><br><br><h1>Rancor, Adult</h1><br><h2>Unaligned</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"The rancor is deadly and one of the most hideous beasts I have ever encountered, best described as a walking collection of fangs and claws, with no thought other than to kill and eat."</i></p><p>- Mammon Hoole</p></blockquote><table class="userscript-table userscript-table-bordered" style="width:615.455px"><tbody><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Designation</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">Semi-sentient</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Classification</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">Reptomammals</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857">Subspecies</td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Bull rancor</li><li>Chrydslide</li><li>Felucian rancor</li><li>Gnarled rancor</li><li>Jungle rancor</li><li>Rancor-dragon</li><li>Tyrant rancor</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Average height</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">5-19 meters</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Average mass</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">1.650 kilograms (5 meter specimen)</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Skin color</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Brown</li><li>Dark Brown</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Distinctions</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Long arms</li><li>Claws</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Homeworld</u><br></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Dathomir (Native)</li><li>Felucia&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent">(Introduced)</span></li><li>Lehon&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent">(Introduced)</span></li><li>Carida (Introduced)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Diet</u><br></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><p>Carnivorous</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Rancors were large carnivorous reptomammals native to the planet of Dathomir. They were usually born brown, but in special circumstances, such as the mutant rancor, jungle rancor, and the bull rancor, their color may have differed. Although found on other worlds such as Lehonâ€”where they were brought by crashed starshipsâ€”Ottethan, Carida, Corulag, and Felucia, those from Dathomir were said to be stronger and more intelligent than others. They had been used for many things, ranging from mounts for the Witches of Dathomir, to pets for crime lords such as Jabba Desilijic Tiure, to being a source of food, and as a means of entertainment by dropping someone into its pit.</p><p>Vonnda Ra of the Nightsisters used a stuffed rancor head as a chair. In her youth as a Jedi trainee, Hapan Queen Mother Tenel Ka Djo used two trophy rancor teeth for handles to create both her first lightsaber and second lightsaber. Rancors were also the source of the delicacy (or at least an edible meal) known as raw rancor-beast liver.</p><h3 style="font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif">Biology and appearance</h3><blockquote><p><i>"My rancor seeks flesh!"</i></p><p>- A Nightsister</p></blockquote><p>Warm-blooded rancors fell into the reptomammal category, along with other creatures such as the wampa. Rancors were attracted to other rancor mates by a smell, or a pheromone. While it is known that rancors did care for their youngâ€”usually born two at a timeâ€”they did not suckle and hatched from eggs like those of a reptile. The 3 meter tall hatchlings rode the mother, one dorsal, one ventral, until reaching maturity, though despite this nurturing nature, it was not entirely unheard of for a mother to eat her young.</p><p>Rancors walked on two relatively stubby legs, with longer forelimbs utilized for catching prey, though they also walked on all fours at times and had a short tail. A rancor's flat face was dominated by a large mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. Although it had sharp teeth, it would often swallow smaller prey (such as humanoids) whole. The skin of a rancor was tough enough to deflect blaster bolts, making it an efficient killing machineâ€”and an excellent source of leather for expensive vests and boots. At least on Dathomir, rancors had good night vision, but their eyesight was not as sharp as a Human's in daylight.</p><p>Rancors had a symbiotic relationship with gibbit birds, an avian species that would clean their teeth, an action that provided the birds with food and the rancors with a form of "dental hygiene."</p><p>In certain cases, rancors were sentient enough to be able to form and recite complex oral traditions, such as Tosh, herd-mother of a rancor family that belonged to the Singing Mountain Clan on Dathomir. Tionne Solusar recorded one such narrative surrounding a witch identified as the fallen Jedi Allya, who lived over six centuries before.</p><h3 style="font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif">History</h3><p><b>Dathomir</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"Come to me rancor!"</i></p><p>- Silri</p></blockquote><p>Though they were usually considered unintelligent beasts, the rancors of Dathomir at least were semi-sentient, caring creatures who mourned their family members when they died, and who passed on oral histories of the matriarchal herds into which these were organized. Their native way of life seems to have been very primitive, using their strength and size to hunt live prey across the planet's savannahsâ€”with the planet's Human population at one point becoming their primary prey species; but in the last centuries of the Galactic Republic, the rancor was "domesticated" by the Witches of Dathomir (though Force-sensitivity was apparently necessary to accomplish the difficult task) and the symbiosis of rancor sow and female rider seems to have played a major role in dictating the subsequent structure of Dathomiri society. According to the rancors' own traditions, the symbiosis began when a warrior-woman met and healed an injured female; by mounting the rancor's back, her sharper eyesight enabled it to hunt better prey during the day, so that it grew in size and status to become a mighty herd-mother.</p><p>By the time of the New Republic, most of Dathomir's rancor population lived in symbiosis with the planet's Witches of Dathomir clans, being used as mounts, and learning to make and use armor and bladed weapons with their help. Rancors of a clan were marked to show clan ownership, but younger ones were not marked and could basically serve as undercover mounts, belonging to no clan.</p><p>Around the years of the Galactic Empire, it was believed that the last herds of untamed mountain rancors were driven into the plains and destroyed; but a few decades later, a wild herd wandered into the Great Canyon, indicating that a population had survived in the vast tracts of Dathomir's surface area that remained unexplored, far beyond the knowledge of the planet's Human population. On Dathomir they would often eat pig-like rodents.</p><p><b>The wider galaxy</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"I had to kill a rancor once. It was a shameâ€”they're such fine creatures."</i></p><p><i>"Even so, they are dangerous to those who are not their friends."</i></p><p>- Luke Skywalker and Tenel Ka Djo, about Jabba's rancor</p></blockquote><p>The rancor was relatively well known in the wider galaxy, having spread across various planets with early spacefaring civilizations even before the rise of the Old Republic; but the rancor's homeworld had been forgotten, and its sapience was rarely recognized. Among the planets that housed rancor populations were Carida, Corulag, Dantooine, Ohma-D'un, Trinta and Regosh. The Jedi Order named the Niman style of lightsaber combat after the rancor. This was a style that was known for being well rounded, with no certain offensive or defensive attributes. This might have suggested something about the rancor's predatory style.</p><p>On a few worlds like Ottethan, rancors were used as mounts by warrior clans as they were on Dathomir. Herds of young rancors roamed wild on Lehon, descended from those brought by the Infinite Empire, and some were domesticated as beasts of war by the Black Rakata under The One. Several of those rancors attacked Revan after he betrayed the promise given to The One to kill the Elder Rakata. Revan also had to fight his way to the Ancient Temple and to the Elder Rakata's enclave through rancors who surrounded the former and guarded the latter. While stranded on Taris, the reformed Revan had to pass a rancor in order to infiltrate the Black Vulkars base. He did this by placing a synthetic odor that made the rancor think that its prey was nearby within a pile of corpses, where a grenade was placed. The rancor, grabbing what it thought was food, swallowed the grenade, which exploded in its mouth and killed the beast. Thousands of years later Darth Bane encountered more rancors of Lehon while following Revan's path.</p><p>Rancors were perhaps most closely associated with the criminal underworld, where individual creatures were kept as pets, guards and status-symbols. Rancors were occasionally used for gambling matches, pitting one beast against another or unleashing one upon slaves and seeing which one survived the longest. One such gambling ring existed on Nar Kreeta. Infamous slaver Phylus Mon, who dealt in rancors, also used two crossed rancor claws as the symbol of his organization. Sometimes Phylus Mon used rancors to attack his personal enemies, and sometimes his enslaved Force adepts created illusions of rancors to attack his enemies. Rancors were also kept by such criminals as Nirama, Hlisk Squin, Borvo the Hutt, and the crimelord from Nar Kreeta.</p><p>The inhabitants of Felucia managed to tame the local rancors in a manner similar to Dathomiri Witches. They also used the rancors as mounts, and the bones of the deceased creatures were made into weapons. In addition, they usually painted the rancors with fluorescent paints to make them look more intimidating. These rancors were used by the Jedi Shaak Ti and Maris Brood. Several of those rancors were slain by Galen Marek during his mission in 2 BBY. The Zann Consortium used many rancors with Nightsisters astride them in their campaign to corrupt the galaxy, most notably Nightsister Silri's pet, Cuddles.</p><p>Perhaps the most famous such rancor was the one owned by Jabba Desilijic Tiure, who kept it in a pit beneath his palace courts, dropping in victims who displeased him in some way in order to feed it. His rancor was cared for by Malakili, a famous beast tamer who had traveled with the Circus Horrificus. Malakili formed an unlikely bond with the animal, even going so far as to sneak the rancor out of Jabba's palace for a run in the desert, and wept when the beast was killed by Luke Skywalker.</p><p>The Galactic Empire attempted to exploit the combat potential of the rancorâ€”perhaps not a great surprise given that a fully grown Dathomiri rancor was capable of single-handedly destroying an entire AT-ST unit.</p><h3 style="font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif">Subspecies</h3><p>Many subspecies of rancors existed, both on Dathomir and other worlds. Among the subspecies of Dathomiri rancors were the gnarled rancor and the rancor pygmy. Offworld breeds had evolved into such distinct subspecies, such as the amphibious Tra'cor found on Socorro or the gigantic tyrant rancor. An extremely rare variant was the bull rancor of Felucia, an ancient and near-mythical beast that was marked by its paler flesh, elongated tail and immense horns that sprouted from its massive head. One such rancor was tamed and used as a pet by the Dark Jedi Maris Brood.</p><p>Several subspecies did not evolve naturally, but were instead bred, using either genetic manipulations or Sith alchemy. One such variant was the jungle rancor, which was quite different from its common brethren and was found on worlds such as Teth. The Sith Lord Quorlac Fornayh used the Sith Alchemy to create Coloi, a rancor with lighter bones and large wings, who had the skin replaced with black metallic plating that could serve as armor. Only one such creature existed and was subsequently destroyed. The reborn Emperor Palpatine also kept several alchemically altered Chrysalide rancors at his citadel on Byss in order to defend it.</p><p>Other mutant rancors were unique and impossible to classify. In 14 ABY a mutant rancor was bred by the Disciples of Ragnos, who planned on releasing the beast in Taanab cities so that during the chaos they could steal arms, credits, and other needed goods. The beast was much larger than normal rancors, had green capsules on its back, could breathe a stream of green toxic gas, and had an unnatural green hue to its skin. However, once released, the rancor began attacking the Disciples themselves, who were unable to stop it, as the mutant was immune to conventional weapons. Eventually it was killed by the Jedi Jaden Korr, who managed to pin it between a force field and a large crate on a conveyor belt.</p><p>Another example of a mutant rancor is the Undead rancor, which was mutated by Imperial Bioweapons Project I71A, and resided on Dathomir in the Imperial Quarantine Zone. This rancor was later killed by a group of spacers.</p><br><br><br><br><h1>Rancor, Juvenile</h1><br><h2>Unaligned</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"The rancor is deadly and one of the most hideous beasts I have ever encountered, best described as a walking collection of fangs and claws, with no thought other than to kill and eat."</i></p><p>- Mammon Hoole</p></blockquote><table class="userscript-table userscript-table-bordered" style="width:615.455px"><tbody><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Designation</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">Semi-sentient</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Classification</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857">Reptomammals</td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857">Subspecies</td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Bull rancor</li><li>Chrydslide</li><li>Felucian rancor</li><li>Gnarled rancor</li><li>Jungle rancor</li><li>Rancor-dragon</li><li>Tyrant rancor</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Skin color</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Brown</li><li>Dark Brown</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Distinctions</u></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Long arms</li><li>Claws</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Homeworld</u><br></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><ul><li>Dathomir (Native)</li><li>Felucia&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent">(Introduced)</span></li><li>Lehon&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent">(Introduced)</span></li><li>Carida (Introduced)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td style="line-height:1.42857"><u>Diet</u><br></td><td style="line-height:1.42857"><p>Carnivorous</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Rancors were large carnivorous reptomammals native to the planet of Dathomir.

Trained for reconnaissance and warfare over difficult terrain, a battalion of scout troopers deployed to the planet Kashyyyk during the final days of the conflict, and fought alongside the native Wookiees against the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems.</p><h3>History</h3><p><b>Clone Wars</b></p><p>Clone scout troopers were a variant of the Galactic Republic's clone trooper, trained in reconnaissance and warfare over difficult terrain. Before larger troop actions, small groups of the scouts were deployed to survey territory, and, because of their survival skills, they were suited for fighting in wilderness conditions.</p><p>During the final year of the Clone Wars, the 41st Scout Battalionâ€”led by Jedi Generals Yoda and Luminara Unduli, as well as Clone Commander CC-1004 "Gree"â€”was deployed to the planet Kashyyyk to aid the Wookiees in their fight against the Separatist Droid Army. As Confederate forces stormed the beach, scout troopers were tasked with defending Kachirho, the capital of Kashyyyk. Using barricades and trenches as cover, the scout troopers and Wookiees engaged the battle droids in a brutal confrontation. A number of scout troopers acted as sharpshooters along Tree Kachirho whilst many more lined the top of the seawall. During the battle, Commander Gree received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine and proceeded to carry out the order. He approached Grand Master Yoda and the Wookiee generals, atop a high command post overlooking the battle, and prepared to fire on his commanding officer. However, the Jedi felt a great disturbance in the Force, as Order 66 was carried out across the the galaxy, and beheaded Gree and another clone before they could execute him.</p><p><b>Legacy</b></p><p>After the Galactic Empire was established, the Grand Army of the Republic transitioned into the Imperial Army and Stormtrooper Corps. Like the Republic, the Empire made use of its own scout troopers, who saw action throughout the Imperial Era.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Clone scout troopers were equipped with camouflaged Phase II ARF armor and were trained for reconnaissance.

A combination of excellent design, high-quality marketing, and good timing made this astromech droid one of the most sought after droids in history, and one of the few vintage astromech series still in active production decades after it was first designed, including the prototype R2-0. The line was so successful, even being given a positive review by Mechtech Illustrated for its versatility, that the Galactic Empire would later take credit for the design. The average cost for an R2 unit was about 4245 Republic Credits.</p><h3>Functions</h3><p>Like its forerunners, the R2 astromech was designed to work in and around space vessels as a diagnostic and repair unit. But unlike the clunky R1-series, this rounded, waist-high droid was made specifically to fit in military starfighter astromech slots. This was a radical departure, as previously all such droids had been dedicated government models. The droid was equally popular with Galactic Republic fighter jocks as it was with the general public.</p><p>When plugged into a T-65 X-wing starfighter, Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, or similar starfighter, the R2 monitored flight performance, pinpointed and corrected technical problems, and performed power management, optimizing shipboard systems. Its ROM library had reference and repair designs for well over seven hundred starship models to ensure it was able to do its functions in repairwork, with its Intellex IV internal computer scans technical files also co pinpointing potential problems as well as finding data patterns or debug computer codes, allowing it to conduct over 10,000 MPF operations a second. The unit could store up to ten sets of hyperspace vector coordinates in the RAM of its astrogation buffer (thus allowing for even ships with limited navicomputers to make hyperspace jumps and also acting as a backup in the event of navicomputer malfunctions), and many had the intelligence and experience to perform engine startup and pre-flight taxiing. The R2 operated flawlessly in the vacuum of interstellar space. R2 units were equipped with a holographic recording mode.</p><h3>Components</h3><p>The center of the droids' success could be attributed to its Intellex IV computer, which featured at least 700 different spacecraft configurations and could do over 10000 MPF operations every second. Likewise, its built-in telecom software also allowed it to communicate with computers under the jurisdiction of both the Imperial Navy Transmission and the Corporate Sector Standard communications systems, as well as being given custom communications software. Its sensor package was equally impressive, with a full-spectrum transceiver and electromagnetic, heat, motion, and life form indicators. The droid also had a fully maneuverable video sensor, deployed from its domed head, allowing it to inspect enclosed spaces or peer over obstacles. The line also possessed a retractable jack that allowed the unit to plug directly into Imperial-standard computer ports, thus allowing it a direct hard-wired connection to most computers. It also had a flexible video sensor unit that allowed the R2 unit to examine hard-to-see workspaces via a 360-degree rotational joint, with a maximum reach of .85 meters. Aside from its video sensors, the R2-line also had a wide sensor array for almost any purpose, including a full spectrum transceiver, electrophoto receptors, DERs and heat and motion detectors, all of which are routed to the R2's Intellex IV internal computer that supported sophisticated analysis programs including life-form identification subroutines.</p><p>The droid's outer shell concealed an array of tools beneath its streamlined durasteel exterior. Each R2 came equipped from the factory with two manipulator arms (a heavy duty grasper with 25 kilo lifting capacity and 10 kilo grasping measure as well as a fine manipulator with 2 kilo lifting capacity with three 360-degree rotational joints for complete maneuverability and micro-adjustment controls that allowed for better than one micrometer placement accuracy; both manipulators have a .85 meter reach and are fully retractable within the body when not in use[1]), an electric arc welder, circular saw, computer scomp link arm, VicksVisc holographic recorder/projector unit, internal cargo compartment, and a general-use fire extinguisher, all of which came at no extra cost if purchased with the R2 unit. IA, taking a page from Corellian ship-builders, made the droids easy to upgrade and modify. The company offered a variety of after-market packages, but industrious owners also managed to equip R2s with such eclectic items and accessories as underwater propellers, laser pointers, jet thrusters, remote sensor limpets, and inflatable life rafts. This adaptability made the R2 units particularly popular among tech-heads, who often would have running competitions over who could outfit the most eclectic droid.</p><p>IA spent a great deal of time in the design of the R2's personality matrix. The droid was obliging, quick witted, and sincere. If the droid was not subjected to periodic memory wipes, it could develop a headstrong, self-reliant disposition. Many owners, however, actually preferred a droid willing to offer candid second opinions. Starfighter pilots tended to develop a strong bond with their astromech droids, often flying all their missions with one particular droid, and strongly objected to the memory wipes their counterparts were given on a regular basis in some units.</p><p>At least by the time of the Galactic Civil War, R2 purchases came with a three-year warranty, a user-support hotline, IA quality, various affordable prices, and dealer financing.</p><h3>R2-D2</h3><blockquote><p><i>"An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Captain Quarsh Panaka to Queen Amidala</span></p></blockquote><p>The most notable R2-series astromech droid was R2-D2. He participated in numerous battles during both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. It was R2 who helped deliver the Death Star plans to the Rebellion, allowing their victory at the Battle of Yavin, and a message from Princess Leia to Obi-Wan Kenobi, which caused Luke Skywalker to leave Tatooine and go on to become a Jedi Knight.</p><p>Ever since the droid came to the public's attention shortly after the destruction of the first Death Star, despite having played a major part in many previous events, sales showed their highest increase since the launch of the series. IA resisted the urge to feature R2-D2's heroics in its HoloNet advertisements released after the fall of the Galactic Empire for fear of alienating New Republic leaders.</p><br><br><br><br><h1>Security Officer</h1><br><h2>lawful balanced</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"Clear the bridge.

Representing the future of galactic warfare, clones were designed to be far superior to battle droids. During the last years of the Galactic Republic, clones formed the backbone of the Republic Military that waged war against the droid armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Clone Wars was named after the Republic's clone army, which became symbolic of the conflict that had spread throughout the galaxy after a millennium of peace.</p><p>Clone troopers were grown on the planet Kamino at the request of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, having secretly commissioned the Kaminoans to build an army for the Republic. After his death, the project was taken over by the Sith. Clones were modeled on a human template, the bounty hunter Jango Fett, although their genetic structure was modified to make them less independent and more docile than their progenitor. They were also designed to age at twice the rate of natural humans, accelerating their growth and making them ready for combat in a decade's time. As the Separatist Crisis gave way to open war, the Galactic Senate empowered Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine to call the clone troopers into action, leading to their debut on the battefield of Geonosis. For three years, clones fought the Separatist droids on all fronts across the galaxy. They were loyal to their Jedi Generals and the Supreme Chancellor; though some clones questioned their service, leading to isolated cases of desertion and treason, most were proud to serve the Republic as it was the only life they had ever known.</p><p>Galactic history was forever changed by a hidden control chip implanted in every clone. Chancellor Palpatine, discovered by the Jedi to be the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, issued Order 66â€”calling for the annihilation of the Jedi Order. With the Jedi labeled as enemies of the state, the clones turned against their generals, slaughtering them across worlds and inside the Jedi Temple on Coruscant under the stewardship of the Sith Lord Darth Vader. Sidious subsequently assumed absolute power as the self-proclaimed Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Clones initially served as Imperial stormtroopers in the New Order, but were soon replaced by human conscripts. Their armor, weapons, and training inspired generations of white-armored warriors, especially the First Order stormtroopers who were also trained from early childhood to become super-soldiers.</p><h3>History</h3><p><b>Origin</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"They are totally obedient, taking any order without question. We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"And who was the original host?"</i></span></p><p><i>"A bounty hunter called Jango Fett."</i></p><p>- Lama Su and Obi-Wan Kenobi</p></blockquote><p>Years before the Invasion of Naboo, Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas came to believe that the galaxy would soon become engulfed by war. He therefore advocated for the creation of an army to ensure the defense of the Galactic Republic, but his views were ultimately rejected by his peers and he was cast out of the Jedi High Council. Undeterred by the lack of support from the other Jedi, Sifo-Dyas secretly contacted the Kaminoansâ€”a species of experts in cloning, native to the planet Kaminoâ€”and commissioned them to create an army of clone soldiers for the Republic without authorization from either High Council or the Galactic Senate.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Sifo-Dyas was killed by the Pyke Syndicate at the behest of the Sith, resulting in the Sith's takeover of the clone trooper project. Darth Tyranus, the apprentice of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, recruited the bounty hunter Jango Fett to become the genetic template of the clone army. Various modifications were made to the Fett genome so that the clones would grow faster and be more susceptible to following orders. Hyper-aggressive and volatile tendencies were tailored; the Kaminoans resorted to growth acceleration in order to create mature clones in half the time a human took to reach maturity. Fett's genetic structure was further modified to make the clones less independent and more docile than their template. However, the clones were also designed to be capable of creative thinking, making them far superior to battle droids according to Prime Minister Lama Su. In addition to Fett's financial compensation, the bounty hunter requested an unaltered clone for himself. As a result, the clone known as Boba Fett was created without the genetic modifications that caused the other clones to grow faster and obey orders without question. Jango became a near-mythologized figure, and clones came to view him as their father figure. However, the bounty hunter himself had no pride in the army, stating they were the cloners' creation and viewing them as livestock made to be cannon fodder.</p><p>Although the Kaminoans believed that the army was meant to serve the Republic, the Sith intended to use the clone troopers as their secret weapon against the Jedi Order. The clone army's true purpose was to exterminate the Jedi, and to that end an organic inhibitor chip was implanted into the brain of every clone trooper at the third stage of their development, of which at least one failed in clone trooper Tup, causing him to kill a Jedi beforehand. Officially, the chips were supposed to make the clones less aggressive and independent than Jango Fett. The significance of the inhibitor chip was supported by the assertion that a clone would become mentally unstable and dangerous to everyone around him if his chip was damaged or surgically removed. The chips were, in fact, created to compel the clone troopers to execute Order 66â€”a secret protocol that authorized the destruction of the Jedi Order.</p><p>Each clone trooper had an identifying code inserted in his left wrist. During the Clone Wars, the codes were linked to the file of every individual trooper in the Republic's military database. The files, which could be accessed by an astromech droid via the scanning of a clone's identifying code, contained the clones' designation, rank and overall service record, as well as any specialized training and the units that he was affiliated with. Most clones also shared their template's dark-brown eyes, black hair, and olive skin. While there were some genetic variations, most of these clones would ultimately remain confined to Kamino, being embarrassments or case studies.</p><p>Within a decade after Sifo-Dyas commissioned the creation of the clone army, the first two-hundred thousand units were ready with a million more underway. Around the same time, the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the clone project on Kamino and duly informed the Jedi Council. By then, the galaxy was on the verge of a civil war between the Republic and a secessionist movement that ultimately formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Since the Jedi lacked sufficient manpower to guard the entire Republic, the Senate resolved to grant emergency powers to the executive branch. As a result, the clone troopers were formally organized into the Grand Army of the Republic by Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatineâ€”the elected leader of the Senate and public persona of Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith.</p><p><b>Clone Wars</b></p><p><u>Soldiers of the Republic</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"I have to admit that without the clones, it would have not been a victory."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"Victory? Victory you say? Master Obi-Wan, not victory. The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun the Clone War has."</i></span></p><p>- Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda</p></blockquote><p>Clone troopers were deployed into battle for the first time on the planet Geonosis, where twelve Acclamator-class assault ships supplied by Kamino were loaded with two battle armies, or 192,000 troops. Under the leadership of the Jedi, the Grand Army of the Republic forced the Separatist Droid Army into full retreat and consequently won the first battle of the Clone Wars. In the wake of the Republic victory on Geonosis, Count Dookuâ€”the alter ego of Darth Tyranusâ€”rallied a growing number of dissenting worlds to the Separatist cause, further dividing the Republic and forcing the clone troopers to fight the war on all fronts across the galaxy.<br></p><p>Throughout the conflict, clone troopers continuously demonstrated extreme loyalty to the Galactic Republic, especially their Jedi Generals and the Supreme Chancellor. Yet while the clones were conditioned to be absolutely obedient, every clone developed his own unique identity. Though encouraged to identify with their cohort, the clones received no time to form friendships beyond a soldier's bond. Insufficient or rushed field care led some clone veterans to have deep, physical scars. These soldiers wore their scars with pride, and some refused rehabilitative treatment to remove them.</p><p>The distinction between each clone ranged from loyal units, such as Clone Commander CC-2224 "Cody" and Clone Captain CT-7567 "Rex," to a minority of clones who proved to be disloyal or uncommitted to the Republic's cause, such as Clone Sergeant "Slick." Regarding service as slavery, Slick betrayed the Republic by accepting bribes from the Separatists and was therefore arrested as a traitor by the Grand Army. Another clone trooper displayed aberrant behavior by deserting the Grand Army and becoming a farmer under the name "Cut Lawquane." For the most part, however, the clones found pride in their purpose as soldiers, and many continued to sacrifice their lives for the Republic. The clones fought alongside the Jedi and each other, and clone troopers viewed each other as brothers. While admirable, this quality could keep them from seeing the bigger picture and make them willfully ignorant of the Republic's politics. In particular, clones tended to view their fellow soldiers as family, fallen comrades as ancestors, and new recruits as descendants. Troopers also tended to see their barracks or starships as places of work.</p><p>As the Clone Wars dragged on, the stress of combat and high casualties caused cracks and strains among the ranks of the clone soldiers. Personality quirks, once considered harmless or even essential to their mental development, began to express themselves in extreme and polarizing ways. Each unit created their own rituals, small ways to identify squad mates, those from the same company, and veterans of specific campaigns. A soldier that talked about "cracking that crystal" identified themselves as a veteran of Christophsis and the assault on Crystal City, while an officer calling targets "bugs" revealed he fought in the hives on Geonosis. While many clones respected a soldier with a different background, some felt separated by time, space, and the unique aspects of their struggle.</p><p>Though the vast majority of clones remained loyal to the Republic over the course of the three-year conflict, as time progressed a small number began to question their strict obedience. Naive new clones fresh from the clone tanks found themselves fighting alongside veterans with years of combat experience, the deaths of comrades, objectives gained and failed, and the often-ineffectual civilian Republic leadership. Consequently, some veterans developed a skepticism of Republic bureaucracy that shocked even the most cynical of rookie clones. Unlike most "natural" species where youth question their elders, it was the older clones of the Grand Army of the Republic who found themselves questioning their values and traditions. These clones still found comfort in the company of their brothers, but life no longer seemed as cut and dry to them.</p><p><u>Public image</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"Valiant men, the clones have proven to be. Saved my life and yours they have many times. Believe in them we must."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Yoda</span></p></blockquote><p>Throughout the Clone Wars, clone troopers featured prominently in propaganda sponsored by both the Republic and Separatist media. Through the Commission for the Protection of the Republic, a populist organization commonly known as COMPOR, clones were portrayed as the public face of the Republic's war effort, resulting in the publication of patriotic artwork such as Unite and Support the Boys in White. The posters expressed patriotism and civic duty to the citizens of the Republic. Part of a large outreach campaign, clone troopers became the symbol of the war effort, largely replacing the Jedi of previous years. Projecting strength and unity, they reminded citizens that their sacrifices were funding peace through military might.<br></p><p>Such messages were intended to ingrain the image of the clone trooper as brave soldiers risking all for freedom, democracy and the Republic. Although COMPOR also wanted to use the Jedi Order as a tool for propaganda, Chancellor Palpatine advised against this course of action, citing sympathy for the Jedi's reluctant acceptance of their new role during wartime. As a result, very few examples of pro-Jedi messages exist as COMPOR devoted their full attention to promoting support for the clone troopers as well as loyalty to the Republic and, in particular, Chancellor Palpatine.</p><p>By contrast, the Confederacy of Independent Systems decried the clone army as a biological abominationâ€”an inhumane practice in which weaponized embryos were carried to artificial term and turned into disposable killing machines. The Separatist cause was, therefore, portrayed as the more "humane" approach due to the Confederacy's use of battle droids. As the war carried on, more Republic citizens became disillusioned with the seemingly endless conflict, allowing Separatist and anti-war propaganda to take root in the Republic's territory. Widespread discontent began to erode the clones' public image despite COMPOR's efforts; even their civilian-coined nickname "Boys in White" backfired as anti-war activists pointed to the fact that the clones were barely thirteen years old by the third year of the Clone Wars.</p><p><b>Order 66</b></p><p><u>Sith conspiracy</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"I like a good mystery."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"Yeah?

CT-5385 "Tup" was a clone trooper in the 501st Legion who became mentally unstable when his inhibitor chip malfunctioned during the Battle of Ringo Vinda, causing him to kill Jedi General Tiplar. This premature execution of Order 66 resulted in an investigation by the Republic, the Jedi, and the Kaminoans. The Sith also took an interest in the matter; Count Dookuâ€”whom Lama Su and Nala Se knew only as "Tyranus," their secret benefactorâ€”instructed the Kaminoans to prevent the Jedi from discovering the true purpose of the inhibitor chips. Tyranus was also disturbed by the degree of individuality that the clones displayed in spite of their psychological conditioning; Nala Se believed that the Jedi were responsible for encouraging greater creative thinking in the clones. Nevertheless, she was certain that, with the exception of Tup's damaged chip, the rest of the chips would function according to their design.</p><p>During the investigation, ARC trooper CT-5555 "Fives" became increasingly convinced that the inhibitor chip was part of a conspiracy against the Republic and the Jedi. Against Nala Se's advice, he was allowed to plead his case to Chancellor Palpatine. However, their meeting led the ARC trooper to believe that the Chancellor was involved in the conspiracy, although he was unaware of to what extent. Jedi Master Shaak Ti witnessed Fives's attempt to assassinate the Chancellor and prevented him from succeeding. Soon after his escape from the Grand Republic Medical Facility, Fives, who was trying to warn Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex, was cornered by the clone shock troopers of the Coruscant Guard and executed by Commander CC-1010 "Fox", commander of the Coruscant Guard. The investigation falsely concluded that Tup's chip was infected by a rare parasite native to Ringo Vinda and Fives succumbed to madness after removing his own chip on Kamino.</p><p>Shortly before dying, Tup and Fivesâ€”both of whom had their chips removedâ€”described Order 66 as a mission that they repeatedly experienced in their nightmares. With their deaths and the removal of any evidence that could alert the Jedi to the existence of Order 66, the Chancellor convinced the Jedi Council that the clone troopers did require their inhibitor chips. Still, Rex, who had held Fives as he died, submitted a grievance report, where he stated the inhibitor chips could have an alternate purpose. While he was not sure if he believed it and knew the report would be ignored, Rex believed he owed it to Fives to record what he had learned.</p><p>The death of Fives did not completely ensure the secrecy of Order 66, however. The Jedi Council began inquiring into the specific circumstances regarding the mysterious death of Sifo-Dyas, the founder of the clone army. Alarmed by the Jedi's interest in the matter, Darth Sidious tasked his apprentice with the responsibility of eliminating any remaining loose ends that could connect the Sith with the creation of the clones. Darth Tyranus journeyed to the planet Oba Diah and killed Minister Lom Pyke of the Pyke Syndicate, but not before the Pyke revealed to the Jedi that Tyranus and Dooku were one and the same.</p><p>The Jedi Council was disturbed by the revelation of the Sith Order's involvement in the creation of the clones. Yet in spite of their suspicions regarding the reasons the Sith would provide the Jedi with an army, the Council ultimately chose to conceal their findings from the public and the government, fearing that such a discovery would undermine public confidence in the war. Moreover, Grand Master Yoda defended the clones' integrity to his peers, believing that the Jedi could trust in their loyalty as they had saved their lives many times and had proven worthy allies.</p><p><u>Fall of the Jedi</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"How widespread is this?"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"Ahsoka, it's all of us. The entire Grand Army of the Republic has been ordered to hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights."</i></span></p><p>- Ahsoka Tano and Clone Commander Rex discuss Order 66</p></blockquote><p>After three years of constant warfare, the Separatist forces attacked Coruscant, the Republic capital world, and managed to abduct Chancellor Palpatine in the process. The clone troopers rallied to Coruscant's defense while the Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker rescued the Chancellor. During the battle, Darth Tyranus was slain by Skywalkerâ€”an act which brought the Clone Wars closer to a successful conclusion for the Republic. The Jedi Council moved to capitalize on the momentum gained by Tyranus' death in the hope of ending the war.</p><p>The Grand Army continued to fight the war on various worlds across the galaxy, including Mygeeto, Felucia, Cato Neimoidia, and Saleucami. New fronts were opened as clone troopers were deployed to Kashyyyk and Utapau; and other planets as part of the Outer Rim Sieges. CC-1004 "Gree" and the 41st Elite Corps fought side-by-side with the Wookiees in the Battle of Kashyyyk, under the command of Yoda, while Kenobi and Cody oversaw the Battle of Utapau between the 212th Attack Battalion and General Grievous's droid army.</p><p>As the Republic drew closer to achieving total victory in the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine revealed his true identity as Darth Sidious to the Jedi, provoking an immediate response from the Jedi Council. The consequent confrontation between the Council and the Dark Lord ended in the deaths of several Jedi Masters, including Mace Windu, and Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side of the Force. Now anointed as the Sith Lord Darth Vader, Sidious's new apprentice participated in the 501st Legion's assault on the Jedi Temple. Under the influence of Order 66, the 501st clone troopers stormed the Temple and exterminated the Jedi within. None of the Jedi were spared, including the younglings.</p><p>Around the same time, Darth Sidious issued Order 66 to the clone troopers throughout the galaxyâ€”declaring every Jedi an enemy of the Republic. Order 66 triggered the hidden chips within the clones, compelling them to comply without question or hesitation with the plan to annihilate the Jedi. The clones turned on their unsuspecting allies and slaughtered them across numerous worlds. With the exception of a few survivors, the Jedi were all but extinct in the aftermath of the initial execution of Order 66. In addition, this protocol did not end with members of the Jedi Order, as clone troopers who failed to comply with the order were to be killed as well. Aboard a Venator-class Star Destroyer, Skywalker's former Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, and the rogue Sith Lord Maul were also targeted by the clones of the 332nd Company, who had been serving with Tano in the Siege of Mandalore. Rex, who had been promoted to be the company's Clone Commander, managed to resist his chip's control for long enough to tell Tano to find Fives. While he then fell victim to its control, Tano escaped the troopers and released Maul from captivity, intending to have him be a distraction. Tano then looked into Fives, finding Rex's grievance report on the chips. With the help of astromech droids R7-A7, CH-33P, and RG-G1, Tano had Rex knocked unconscious and brought to the medical bay, where they removed his chip, freeing him from Order 66.</p><p>After Rex informed Tano that the entire Grand Army had turned against the Jedi and their escape from the medical bay, Tano led Rex and the astromechs to the hangar to steal a shuttle. Elsewhere, Maul continued to move through the warship, ultimately entering and destroying the hyperdrive room. This pulled the Star Destroyer out of hyperspace and into the gravitational field of a moon, but the 332nd remained determined to kill Tano, even if it would result in their own deaths. Even though the clone troopers blocked their path to a Nu-class transport shuttle, Tano did not want to harm the soldiers, but Rex, who shed a tear, informed her of the troops' determination to follow Order 66. Tano was still unwilling to take their lives and devised a plan to stall the troops; while R7 prepared to drop parts of the floor, Rex distracted Clone Lieutenant/ARC trooper CT-5597 "Jesse" and the other clones by bringing Tano before them and explaining a complication with their order. This was that Order 66 commanded the death of the Jedi, but Tano was no longer part of their organization. Jesse rebutted, noting that Rex had told them they were under special order to kill Tano and any disobeying clone. Rex made a final plea to Jesse, but the Clone Lieutenant believed Tano was a traitor and found his superior to be in violation of protocol 66. Stating Rex would be demoted and killed with Tano, Jesse prepared the company to execute their former allies, but R7 then dropped the floor, separating a large portion of the clones and letting Tano and Rex deal with the reminder. However, Maul then entered the hangar and stole their shuttle, forcing them to look for a ship on the hangar's lower level.</p><p>The clone troopers managed to blast the three astromechs, but Tano and Rex found a functional BTL-B Y-wing fighter-bomber before the Venator entered the atmosphere. Once both were inside the Y-wing starfighter, they landed the ship nearby the Venators crash site. The clones aboard the warship, including Jesse, had been killed by the crash, but Tano and Rex buried their former comrades and used their helmets to mark each clone's grave. Tano then abandoned her lightsaber at the site. Eventually parting ways, Rex and Tano had both agreed to leave for the Outer Rim Territories.</p><p><b>Imperial service</b></p><p><u>Soldiers of the Empire</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"I heard they shut down the facilities on Kamino. They'll train up the last batch of clones and that's it."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"But that's crazy. Who will protect the Empire?"</i></span></p><p><i>"Don't know, Kicker. But it won't be us. We get to pack up old Jedi way stations and crate everything back to Coruscant. I think our fighting days are done."</i></p><p>- "Ding" and "Kicker"</p></blockquote><p>Without the Jedi Order, the galaxy fell under the power of the Sith once more. Sidious, having accumulated absolute political and military control over the Republic, was able to become the self-proclaimed Emperor of the First Galactic Empire. The Republic was no more; democracy and liberty were supplanted by the absolute rule of the Sith, leading to sweeping alterations that distinguished the New Order from the old system. During this time of change, all remaining clone troopers were re-designated as Imperial stormtroopers. As a result, the soldiers that once defended the Republic became the Empire's elite shock troops, enforcing the Emperor's will and destroying his enemies during the early days of the new Imperial Era.<br></p><p>Despite the clones' role in the formation and enforcement of the early Empire, the clone trooper production line was halted, causing rumors to spread across the ranks with clones such as "Ding" and "Kicker" pondering the Empire's future and the fate of their kind. Knowing that the clone army had only one generation left in its future, older clones dreaded the notion of retirement and, therefore, sought ways to remain on active duty, such as joining the Emperor's Royal Guard.</p><p>The drop in casualties following the end of the war allowed the Empire to suspend clone production without a major disruption in manpower as new, non-clone recruits took up the mantle. Nevertheless, the Empire continued to make use of clones even as they were gradually phased out of service. Clone troopers were dispatched to secure Jedi sites, such as the Mid Rim Jedi way station Brighthome, a task which the clones found tedious as they preferred to serve on the battlefield. In addition, shock troopers continued to patrol the upper levels of Coruscant and even supported Darth Vader in his efforts to capture Jedi Master Jocasta Nu, the Chief Librarian of the Jedi Temple Archives.</p><p>As time passed, however, the remaining clones were deemed no longer fit for military service due to their accelerated aging process. No longer using fresh clones to replenish the army due to the shutdown of the cloning hatcheries on Kamino, the Empire introduced birth-born human recruits and conscripts into the stormtrooper ranks, thereby causing the Imperial Military to transition from a clone army to a volunteer force. In 14 BBY, Sergeant "Crest" was a clone trooper who still served the Empire, although Darth Vader stated that the clone's aging may have been too fast for him to remain on active duty. However, Vader ultimately promoted Crest to the rank of lieutenant.</p><p>By 4 BBY most clones had been decommissioned and were regarded as obsolete. A small number of clones remained in Imperial service, acting as training instructors for the next generation of stormtroopers. One such clone was TX-828 "Torrent"; as one of the last clones in the Stormtrooper Corps, he was a rare sight by the time of the Battle of Yavin. At that time he was nearing the age of forty due to his accelerated growth process, with strands of gray coloring his black hair. By then the rarity of Torrent kind was such that ISB Senior Commander Alecia Beck was surprised to encounter a stormtrooper from the original Kaminoan production line.</p><p>An Imperial clone stormtrooper known as Crag remained in military service well into the Empire's reign, despite his accelerated age. Having served as a soldier since the time of the Republic, the old clone had a strong sense of duty, which he believed was maintaining order in the galaxy. However, his personality earned the ire of a fellow trooper, Sardis Ramsin, who regarded Crag as a "relic." Crag was serving as a sandtrooper of Foot Patrol 7 when his team deployed to Mos Eisley on Tatooine, shortly before the Battle of Yavin in 0 BBY. They had been sent to capture two droids belonging to the Rebellion, C-3PO and R2-D2, but fell under the influence of a Jedi mind trick performed by an old hermit. Unbeknownst to Crag and his team, the old man with the droids was the Jedi fugitive Obi-Wan Kenobi, who used the Force to dominate the weak-minded troopers in order to move the droids into the city unopposed.</p><p><u>Life after retirement</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"What's the point of all this? I mean, why?"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"I don't know, sir. I don't think anybody knows. But I do know that someday this war is gonna end."</i></span></p><p><i>"Then what? We're soldiers. What happens to us then?"</i></p><p>- CT-7567 and CT-5555</p></blockquote><p>During the later years of the Clone Wars, many clones talked about retirement as a reward for their service, but few knew what it entailed. Indeed, the Republic planned to retire the clones, but neither the government nor the clones knew what that meant. If a soldier brought the subject up, their commander would often put an end to the idle chatter. A few forward-looking clones contemplated work in corporate security or consultation with local militaries owing to their lack of civilian job skills, and their accelerated aging process decreased the likelihood of them learning and mastering such job skills before they died. However, strong loyalties to the former Republic created a moral quandary when it came to security work, as retired clones would possibly be fighting some of their former brethren.</p><p>Before the Republic collapsed, politicians had vetted certain officers about staying in a formalized and permanent Republic military to maintain the peace. A few exceptional clones had even been approached to run for political office. Having proven their loyalty to the Republic, and with the civilian population loving military heroes, many clones would have made ideal candidates were it not for the clones' general disdain for politicking.</p><p><b>Psychological impact of Order 66</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"The kid was right. Billaba was our hero. Yours and mine."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"That traitor? No. Never!"</i></span></p><p><i>"Yes. She was. And Order Sixty-Sixâ€¦ We followed itâ€”I followed itâ€”as if under some kind of spellâ€¦ As if I had no will of my own. No memories of the battles we had fought together. Not for one second did it occur to me to even question the Emperor's command!"</i></p><p><i>"Because when soldiers question orders, people die!"</i></p><p><i>"People died anyway! Master Billaba died at my hands! My friend, let's take one second nowâ€¦ Before it's too late."</i></p><p><i>"You're talking like a Jedi traitor, Grey. We did what we had to do. Anything else is literallyâ€¦ Unthinkable."</i></p><p>- CC-10/994 and "Styles"</p></blockquote><p>Some clones felt bitter and horrified by their actions, having been traumatized by the aftereffects of Order 66. On one occasion, CC-10/994 "Grey" was dismayed by his own thoughtless execution of Order 66â€”an experience which he described as being in trance, and therefore, unable to control his actions. Captain "Styles" did not share his commander's concern over the moral issues of Order 66, however. In an effort to atone for his participation in the Jedi Purge, Grey sacrificed his life to save Caleb Dume, the apprentice of Jedi Master Depa Billaba whom the clone killed while under the influence of Order 66.</p><p>Sometime after the issuing of Order 66 and the removal of Rex's chip, CC-3636 "Wolffe," and CC-5576-39 "Gregor" had their chips removed. In the years that followed the Clone Wars, Rex and the other two clone veterans lived in retirement on Seelos, where they made a home out of a modified All Terrain Tactical Enforcer. Despite the effects of their accelerated growth, the aging clones decided to oppose the Empire by joining the nascent rebellion, a movement dedicated to the restoration of the Republic that the clones once served. Regarding the clones' view of stormtroopers, Rex was generally dismissive of the humans who replaced his brethren.</p><p><b>Clones in the Rebellion</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"Tell me, what's it like to be a traitor?"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"I'm no traitor. You want an answer, ask the Emperor about it."</i></span></p><p><i>"Don't you feel guilty for turning your back on the Empire and joining these rebels?"</i></p><p><i>"These "rebels" are saving people's lives, which is more than the Empire's been doing across the galaxy."</i></p><p>- Jeken and Rex</p></blockquote><p>Although the extensive majority of clone troopers were loyal to the Empire, held in place by training and established organic programming, a few clones were able to discover how to disconnect or repel their programming. Of those few, even fewer decided to rebel against the Empire, mostly due to their increasingly old age or situations. The rebellious clones brought their combat training and experience to the various resistance groups that they joined and were also knowledgeable in Imperial strategy and military bureaucracy. Although clones active in the growing rebellion operated apart from each other, some instances saw several clones working together.<br></p><p>At least one Jedi survivor harbored a grudge against the clones. Kanan Jarrus was traumatized by the events of Order 66, including the sudden execution of his Master, Depa Billaba by their own clone troopers, who betrayed and murdered the Jedi Master without hesitation. This experience caused him to develop a strong sense of bitterness towards the clones. After Clone Captain Rex joined the rebellion, Jarrus still possessed his grudge for a time, but Jarrus came to respect and view him as a friend after the Captain nearly sacrificed himself for Jarrus. After the mission, Jarrus went as far as to salute the clone, which surprised Rex, but he quickly returned it. After the rebellion fully formed into the Alliance to Restore the Republic, Rex continued to serve, and was eventually promoted to the rank of commander in the organization. He served in the Battle of Endor, which would prove to be a major loss for the Empire because of the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader.</p><p><b>Legacy</b></p><p><u>Galactic Empire</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"If it's a fight you want, I hope you brought a better class of soldier than thoseâ€¦stormtroopers."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"They serve the Empire well, and I have a great many of them."</i></span></p><p><i>"You're gonna need all of 'em."</i></p><p>- Rex and Alexsandr Kallus</p></blockquote><p>Although the clone trooper program was decommissioned under the Empire, their service in the Clone Wars inspired a generation of birth-born humans, both throughout the conflict and the years that followed. At the time there was no army to enlist in; save for the clones' Jedi Generals, the Grand Army of the Republic was exclusively based on a single template. The Republic faithful nevertheless wanted to do their part as citizens of the thousand-year democracy; as such, they were encouraged by COMPOR propaganda to purchase war bonds or report acts of sedition to the authorities.<br></p><p>The Commission for the Preservation of the New Order (COMPNOR) built upon the carefully engineered symbols and messages of its COMPOR predecessor to accelerate the vast military expansion as decreed by Emperor Palpatine. For all of COMPOR's efforts to mythologize the clone troopers, portraying them as gallant heroes of the Republic in a barrage of propaganda, clones remained an abstraction in the public's mind. Yet whereas the Grand Army's ranks were exclusively clone-based, the galactic populace was encouraged by COMPNOR to serve the state by doing more than purchasing bonds, reporting treason or rationing supplies. With the cloning operation on Kamino suspended, ordinary citizens volunteered for military service in the hopes of wearing the armor of the Imperial stormtrooper and becoming heroes like the clone soldiers they idolized.</p><p>By the later years of the Galactic Empire, clone troopers and the Grand Army of the Republic were virtually forgotten, becoming what some called a "lost generation," despite their valiant service. By the war's end, clones had saved billions of lives across the galaxy, while their vehicles and equipment inspired new weapons such as the E-11 blaster rifle, based on the common clone weapon the DC-15, and AT-AT, based off the clone tank the All Terrain Tactical Enforcer.</p><p><u>New Republic Era<br></u></p><blockquote><p><i>"Of course I don't believe it! A clone that knows the location of forgotten Separatist treasures? Not only is that ridiculous, but the clones are extinct!"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- A Devaronian, in Takodana Castle</span></p></blockquote><p>The clones of Jango Fett were extinct by the time of the New Republic Era. However, at least one clone trooper was said to have sired a child before dying in the Clone Wars. Sconto, according to his mother, was the son of that clone. Unlike the clone, Sconto aged at a normal rate and was living as a merchant in Utapau's Pau Cityâ€”the site of one of the final battles in the Clone Warsâ€”about thirty years after the Battle of Yavin. Sconto was proud of his heritage and therefore harbored resentment towards the Jedi, whom he held responsible for his father's death.<br></p><p>CT-6116 "Kix," a clone trooper of the 501st Legion, was discovered by the pirate Sidon Ithano over fifty years after the end of the Clone Wars. At the time Ithano located a downed Separatist vessel and decided to raid it, assuming he would find valuable kyber crystals once belonging to Count Dooku. Instead, he found Kix, who had been frozen in stasis since the late Clone Wars, because he had discovered Order 66. The clone medic was deeply saddened when he learned about the end of the Republic and the loss of his brothers, and ultimately joined Ithano's crew due to his expertise in Clone Wars-era technology and the knowledge he possessed regarding the locations of former military locations.</p><p><u>First Order</u></p><blockquote><p><i>"How capable are your soldiers, General?"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px"><i>"I won't have you question my methods."</i></span></p><p><i>"They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army."</i></p><p>- Kylo Ren and Armitage Hux</p></blockquote><p>Among military circles, the clones were remembered for their effectiveness. Determined to reclaim the Imperial legacy, the First Order initiated a clandestine project that centered on conscripting human children into its forces. Trained in live-fire drills and programmed through First Order propaganda, they became the new generation of stormtroopers. As the latest iteration of one of the most distinctive symbols of military might in the galaxy, First Order stormtroopers wore stark white armor derived from that of their Imperial predecessors and the Republic clone troopers who came before them.</p><p>Though General Armitage Hux had complete confidence in his soldiers, convinced they were well trained and programmed, his rival Kylo Ren doubted their loyalty to the First Order and Supreme Leader Snoke. During the cold war with the New Republic, Ren accused Hux's stormtroopers of harboring the potential for treason after FN-2187 betrayed the First Order. The dark warrior suggested that a clone army would be more reliable, using the rogue trooper as an example of a flaw that was potentially systemic to the stormtrooper program. The general responded to Ren's criticism by assuring him that the stormtroopers were exceptionally reliable in their combat skills and allegiance to the First Order.</p><p>At the height of the First Orderâ€“Resistance war, the Sith Eternal cult readied an army of elite soldiers to support the First Order's ultimate push toward galactic conquest. Though they were named after a revived sect of the dark side, Sith troopers were the culmination of decades that the Empire spent attempting to strip individuality from its soldiers. Molding individual beings into fervently loyal extensions of the Emperor's will was a process that experienced much trial and error since the Clone Wars. Darth Sidious was dismayed to discover that clone troopers exhibited disconcerting amounts of free will despite their genetically engineered background and numerous alterations. While the Sith troopers were not clones, they underwent flash-imprinting and loyalty conditioning built upon and advanced beyond the Kaminoan procedures of earlier generations. As a result, they were far more loyal and machine-like than the First Order's trained-from-childhood stormtroopers.</p><h3>Training</h3><blockquote><p><i>"I want you troopers to rememberâ€”we're shoulder-to-shoulder on those front lines. Brothers! And sometimes we may quarrel, but no matter what, we are united. Rule one: we fight together."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- "Colt"</span></p></blockquote><p>In order to rapidly produce a large army, the clones were subscribed to an accelerated training and aging program. All clones went through painful accelerated growth before reaching maturity, all while enduring nonstop training, simulations, and testing. Letter and number identifications were assigned to the clones to remove any sense of identity, as the cloners and trainers on Kamino viewed them as pieces of a machine, and not people. Endless mental and physical drills bled into the clones' "recreation," where they participated in sports and games that resembled battle situations. Any bouts of anger or rebellion were dealt with by placing clones in retraining pods, essentially isolation tanks. Throughout their time on Kamino, their engineers muttered veiled threats of "disposal" if the clones failed their testing. As the war progressed, the Jedi clamped down on the more egregious attitudes, but the engineers of Kamino maintained their view of the clones as merely a product.<br></p><p>As trainees, clones held the rank of clone cadet and were organized into multiple squads for the purpose of learning cooperation and teamwork. Cadets had several kinds of instructors; younger clones were monitored by full-grown clone sergeants and bounty hunters were hired to supervise the older clones. By the time of the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Shaak Ti personally oversaw the training of new generations of clone troopers. ARC troopers were also assigned to inspect the progress of future troopers. Clones deemed exceptional in comparison to the average, rank-and-file trooper, were given specialized training in order to become elite soldiers, such as clone commandos or ARC troopers.</p><p>During the war, Shaak Ti observed how some cadets such as Domino Squad struggled to complete their training. Lama Su, who regarded the Domino clones as sub-standard units, believed they were the result of the Kaminoans' need to stretch their remaining supply of Jango Fett's DNA due to the template's untimely demise on Geonosis. The prime minister also opined that a new genotype would have to be selected in order to produce more clones fit for combat.</p><p>The clones lived and trained in Tipoca City, the capital city of Kamino, throughout their time as cadets. Naturally, clones came to regard Kamino as their homeworld, just as official records did. Training and studying under the soft white lights of the clone facilities, most never saw the rain, oceans, clouds, or sky until they left for combat. Still, from the moment of their birth, the clones received encouragement from their trainers and genetic engineers to leave Kamino, and become soldiers among the stars.</p><p>At least two clone squads were given a tour of the Venator-class Star Destroyer Endurance during the Clone Wars as part of the Clone Youth Brigade. The point of this on-site training exercise was to test the cadets' knowledge regarding the functions and layout of a Star Destroyer. It was also meant to help prepare the cadets for their future as fully trained clone troopers.</p><p>The clones who failed to complete their training were disqualified from becoming soldiers. Instead of military service, failed clonesâ€”such as 99â€”were given janitorial duties and menial work. The cadets who succeeded in their trials were promoted to active duty.[60] Despite technically holding the rank of clone trooper, new troopers were regarded as rookies and referred to as "shinies" by older, more battle-experienced clones.</p><p>Clones were taught Basic, the language of the Galactic Republic. Those who spent a lot of time stationed on a specific planet could adopt a patois of the local language. Clones tended to litter their speech with jargon and slangâ€”such as "clankers" for droidsâ€”incomprehensible to a civilian or a Jedi unfamiliar with military culture.</p><p>As the war progressed, command allowed clones to pursue hobbies within limited parameters to supplement their off-duty training and improve mental health. This improved morale and recovery; however, it also gave clones insight into the "other side" and how the civilian population lived.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><blockquote><p><i>"Generation One armor always holds up."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Rex</span></p></blockquote><p>Phase I clone trooper armor was the first version in the clone trooper armor series. It was issued to clone troopers on Kamino prior to the Clone Wars, and was in service until it was rendered obsolete by Phase II around the time of the Battle of Mon Cala. Both versions of clone trooper armor could be modified with an array of attachments, such as jetpacks and macrobinoculars. To better monitor ground movements and coordinate attacks, all clone troopers held a tracking device within their helmets that allowed controllers on Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ships to better monitor the combat zone.<br></p><p>At first, Phase I armor used color to distinguish clones trained for leadership roles, such as captains and commanders, from each other and the standard troopers in the Grand Army of the Republic. As the Clone Wars progressed, color gradually became used for the purpose of armor customization and unit identification. The trend was maintained during the service of Phase II armor, but was ultimately discarded by the time of the creation of stormtrooper armor after the Clone Wars. The identifying white armor of both Phases signified an honorable symbol of defense; however, the creation of the stormtrooper skewed this symbolism into one of a faceless icon of conformity.</p><p>Clone troopers were armed with the DC-15 blaster rifle and DC-15A blaster for long ranged combat,[2] as well as blaster pistols for standard-ranged combat. They also wielded several types of grenades, including Electro Magnetic Pulse grenades and thermal detonators.</p><br><br><br><br><h1>Stormtrooper, Commander</h1><br><h2>Any Alignment</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"As sure as it is my duty to remain loyal to your command, I also have another duty.

After the InterGalactic Banking Clan secured Grievous's services as an enforcer, they refused to hire his Kaleesh, and thus the cyborg general demanded a cadre of "more intelligent battle droids" to serve him. The construction of the MagnaGuards was then commissioned for Grievous's service, though the Jedi-killing droids were also occasionally employed to escort Count Dooku himself.</p><h3>Appearance and characteristics</h3><blockquote><p><i>"I saw an Intel report on this. I think they are Grievous's personal bodyguard droids. Prototypes built to his specifications. To fight Jedi."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- Anakin Skywalker, to Obi-Wan Kenobi</span></p></blockquote><p>Constructed by Holowan Mechanicals, MagnaGuards were roughly two meters tall, with a humanoid body shape, but possessed a far-superior mechanical anatomy. This allowed for superhuman acrobatics, speed, and combat ability. Their internal systems were furnished with advanced combat learning programs, which, compared to most of the droids utilized by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, allowed the MagnaGuards to adapt to a highly diverse variety of tasks. These tasks ranged from melee and ranged combat to starfighter control. The faces of the MagnaGuards featured two red photoreceptor "eyes," which were complemented by a backup system mounted on the chest. The droid's weapon of choice was the lightsaber-resistant electrostaff, and wore cloaks and head wraps similar to the garments of Grievous's old Izvoshra elite during the general's time as a Kaleesh warlord. They were known to sport Mumuu markings on their cloaks matching those on Grievous' mask. Several models of the IG-100 existed, superficially denoted by colorâ€”black, alabaster, blue, and the rare gray were all spotted throughout the war. Each model had a specific programming, training, and thus specialty. These droids were part of the same Holowan Mechanicals series as the later IG-88 line. MagnaGuards were also capable of speech and were programmed to taunt their opponents in a low growling Basic. Aside from Human speech, they appeared to occasionally use an audible form of droid language. When in distress, such as when pinned to the ground, they also make yelping sounds.</p><p><b>Hardiness</b></p><p>MagnaGuards were fully optimized to battle and kill Jedi. This was due to not only their impeccable melee functionality but also their capability to withstand a massive loss of structural integrity before total system failure, as well as their inability to feel pain. Even after decapitation, or bisection, they could continue to effectively engage a target. The only sure way to destroy a MagnaGuard would be to stab them in the chest. In addition, they were partly plated with strong duranium armor making it very hard for even a Jedi to destroy the droid.</p><p><b>Training</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"The age of the Jedi is over."</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- An unknown MagnaGuard</span></p></blockquote><p>General Grievous was given the bodyguards even though he was very impatient with droids due to their many limitations such as limited artificial intelligence. Count Dooku then commissioned Holowan Mechanicals to develop a cutting-edge warrior droid that would meet Grievous's standards. Upon activation, Grievous destroyed all the MagnaGuards present, venting his frustration at being treated as a droid. Grievous then personally trained the rest of his bodyguards in the seven classic styles of lightsaber combat so that they could effectively engage and then kill Jedi. Grievous would not allow any repairs to be made to the droids, believing that their numerous scrapes and battle scars made them more intimidating to enemies. Grievous engaged his bodyguards in practice fights as part of training, often damaging them in the process.</p><h3>History</h3><blockquote><p><i>"What in the galaxy was that?"</i></p><p><span style="font-size:13px">- RC-1262, upon first sighting an IG-100</span></p></blockquote><p><b>Clone Wars</b></p><p>The droids were first used in combat during the Battle of Parein II 4, where one of Grievous's MagnaGuards killed the Jedi Sannen by thrusting its electrostaff through his throat. The MagnaGuards soon proved to be formidable, capable of taking on Jedi and clone troopers with ease, and were regarded as being even more daunting than droidekas by some. Despite their many strengths however, they were by no means invulnerable as Boba Fett managed to momentarily incapacitate one with an ion stunner during the Second Battle of Xagobah, though the bounty hunter was ultimately defeated and left for dead by Grievous himself. Along with their combat duties, General Grievous eventually began using MagnaGuards to do his dirty work, such as when they were used to torture Jedi Master Koth on Saleucami.</p><p>The MagnaGuards also played a role during Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano's mission to Tatooine, they were attacked in the exosphere by several MagnaGuards piloting Rogue-class starfighters. After destroying the droids and reaching the surface of the planet, Ahsoka Tano fought and destroyed three more MagnaGuards, while Anakin fought off Count Dooku.<br></p><p>During a mission to destroy a CIS listening post near Ruusan, Anakin Skywalker battled several MagnaGuards that were preventing R2-D2 from being rescued.<br></p><p>MagnaGuards were present at Grievous's castle on Vassek's third moon. Upon Grievous's return to his castle, he discovered his force of elite MagnaGuards had mysteriously been deactivated. When Count Dooku alerted him of the infiltration of his castle by Jedi Master Kit Fisto and his former apprentice, Nahdar Vebb, Grievous realized Dooku himself had deactivated his guards to see if Grievous was adept in handling the Jedi by himself, as Grievous had recently suffered a chain of defeats. During this mission, one MagnaGuard was sent to destroy the Nu-class attack shuttle with a rocket launcher, while another squad was sent to destroy Kit Fisto's Jedi starfighter. However, Fisto's astromech droid managed to personally pilot the ship to safety. Meanwhile, Nahdar Vebb, who was already in the Castle, managed to destroy Grievous's entire escort of droids, only to be killed by Grievous himself.</p><p>The bounty hunter, Cad Bane, while under contract with the CIS, was given several MagnaGuards for use in capturing keeper of the kyber memory crystal, Jedi Master Bolla Ropal. One stood sentry as Cad Bane tortured the Jedi to death, afterward using its staff to crudely check for any vital response from the dead Rodian.<br></p><p>The droids were often employed to capture or kill Jedi, such as during the capture of Jedi Master Eeth Koth over Saleucami. The droids aided the General in getting the upper hand on Koth, surrounding the Jedi and slowly wearing him down with electrostaff strikes. Once Koth was captured, the droids tortured the Jedi in a transmission sent to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. However, they were unaware that the Zabrak was still cognizant, resisting their torture, and sending a coded hand signal to alert the Jedi to his location. Dooku also used MagnaGuards in subduing Skywalker during a skirmish on Naboo. Dooku and the MagnaGuards were able to capture Skywalker in order to do prisoner exchange for General Grievous. Two of these droids fought Skywalker and Kenobi atop STAPs on Utapau. The droids were also used during the Battle of Boz Pity, under Dooku. During the battle, two of them distracted Mace Windu long enough for the Count to make his escape, and one of them almost killed Asajj Ventress with a blaster under Dooku's orders.</p><p>Delta Squad was forced to fight several MagnaGuards on Kashyyyk during their rescue of the Wookiee chieftain Tarfful. The clone commandos managed to destroy the droids with great difficulty.</p><p>Near the end of the war, MagnaGuards assisted Grievous in the kidnapping of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the Battle of Coruscant. Shaak Ti faced off dozens of MagnaGuards with difficulty before they retreated, alerting her to the Chancellor's danger. This led to a rescue mission, in which Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi fought two of the droids on the bridge of General Grievous's command ship, the Invisible Hand, before rescuing the Chancellor. Kenobi beheaded his opponent, only to find himself engaging a still-functioning headless droid. Skywalker managed to bisect the second droid as Kenobi finished the first off.</p><p>Kenobi also faced four MagnaGuards on Utapau shortly before his fight with Grievous. He incapacitated three of them immediately upon using the Force to drop a large block of metal upon them. The fourth was partly pinned under the block, and then decapitated by Kenobi.</p><p><b>Post-Clone Wars<br></b></p><p>Following the massacre of the Separatist Council by Darth Vader, under Darth Sidious's orders, all IG-100 MagnaGuards were deactivated. However, the Geonosian Gizor Dellso would later reactivate and use IG-100 MagnaGuards as infantry in his personal army. At least a decade later, two MagnaGuards were reactivated by the Galactic Empire for use as N-K Necrosis's bodyguards, and re-designated as NK-3s. In addition, a delivery was made for a TK-555 bobble-head, a battlefield diorama, and blueprints for the IG-100 MagnaGuards. The bureaucrat Narp Pilyev owned two MagnaGuards and used them as security guards, to protect his apartment on Coruscant. Aside from these examples, other persons of note occasionally employed them as guards and henchmen. Many IG-100s were commissioned at the end of The Clone Wars which was part of the reason that there were enough IG-100s to create a private army.</p><h3>Weapons and equipment</h3><p><b>Armaments</b><br></p><p>Grievous's bodyguards notably wielded high-quality phrik alloy electrostaffs, blunt energy weapons which emitted a visible, pink, electromagnetic pulse on each end. The lightsaber-resistant nature of phrik allowed the MagnaGuards to effectively deflect and attack a Jedi's lightsaber. This, coupled with the specialized combat mechanics of the droids, made them a dangerous enemy, even to those skilled in the Force. Despite their specialization in electrostaffs, the on-board combat systems of the MagnaGuard, coupled with human like hands allowed them to be trained to operate a vast array of available weapons in addition to much more specialized armaments. Depending on the time and necessity, MagnaGuards were known to use blaster rifles, grenades, rocket launchers, remote-controlled drones, and lethally irradiating weapons as well as regular melee weapons.</p><p><b>On-board utilities</b></p><p>Along with their weapons, the droids made use of many gadgets, such as built-in tow-cables, a personal cloaking device, and magnetized limbs. At least one MagnaGuard was known to have the ability to extend its arm many times its usual length. Another tool was a violent self destruct sequence, used if the system was still functional after severe damage. This was utilized by MagnaGuards who were encountered by clone commando squad Delta on Kashyyyk. In addition, these particular droids could fire pairs of small seeking missiles from internal magazines in their back plating.</p><br><br><br><br><h1>Talon I Combat Cloud Car</h1><br><h2>Unaligned</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"What's the last thing to go through an Imperial scout trooper's head when he hits a tree?

To that end, the weapon of a Jedi is the lightsaber, a blade composed of pure energy and different colors such as blue, green, purple or yellow.</p><p><b><i>History.</i></b>&nbsp;Before the time of the Galactic Empire, a Jedi was a guardian of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic. The Jedi's commitment to peace and democracy brought them into conflict with an order of dark side wielders known as the Sith, who sought power and dominion over the galaxy. Emerging victorious from their wars with the ancient Sith, the Jedi carried on in their duty as peacekeepers for over a millennium until the advent of the Clone Wars twenty-two years before the Battle of Yavin. Faced with a pan-galactic civil war between the Republic and Confederacy of Independent Systems, the Jedi adopted the mantle of generals and soldiers in the Grand Army of the Republic. After three years of conflict, the Jedi discovered that the war had been a ploy designed to restore the Sith to power. However, the Jedi were betrayed by one of their ownâ€”the Chosen One, Anakin Skywalker, who had been seduced to the dark side and anointed Darth Vader by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Using the Jedi's own clone troopers to initiate a systematic purge of the Jedi Order, the Lords of the Sith all but eradicated the Jedi in one fell swoop, reducing the order from thousands of Jedi Knights to a handful of survivors who dispersed into exile across the galaxy.</p><p>After Luke Skywalker redeemed his father, Anakin, and destroyed the Sith, the New Republic was founded. During the era of the New Republic, Skywalker worked to rebuild the Jedi Order by training many apprentices.</p><p><b><i>Philosophy.</i></b>&nbsp;The Jedi Knights focus on calmness and peace to channel their powers in the Force, using the light side of the Force to serve in the capacity of guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy. Even so, the Jedi seek to preserve balance in the Force; the ancient prophecy of the Chosen One foretold of a being who would restore balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. In combat, whereas an enemy may grow impatient and rely on their overwhelming strength, a Jedi would meditate and find serenity in their mind to focus. A Jedi uses their lightsaber only for defense, not for attack, and uses the Force for defense and knowledge rather than using it to gain power over others. Because of this, some Jedi are capable of appearing after death as Force spirits. Knowledge, the Force, and self-discipline are considered the three pillars of Jedi strength.</p><h3 style="font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif">Jedi Knight</h3><p></p><div class="userscript-column-break" style="font-family:&quot;open sans&quot; , sans-serif;font-size:14px;background-color:rgb( 236 , 240 , 241 )"></div><p></p><p style="margin-bottom:10.5px;line-height:1.2em;z-index:15;overflow:hidden">Jedi Knight was a rank within the Jedi Order, referring to Jedi who had completed their training and passed the Jedi Trials to become a full member of the Order. Jedi Knights, like the Order they served, were guardians of peace and justice in the Galactic Republic, and served in key military command roles during the Clone Wars. At the war's end, Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatineâ€”secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidiousâ€”issued Order 66, declaring every Jedi an enemy of the state. As a result, the clone troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic turned against their generals, killing most of the Jedi Knights. At the end of the Galactic Civil War, Luke Skywalker was the last known Jedi Knight.</p><br><br><br><br><h1>Warden Droid</h1><br><h2>Unaligned</h2><br><blockquote><p><i>"Still resisting?

The most notable member of this species was the warrior Chewbacca, Han Solo's best friend and co-pilot, who played a vital role in the Clone Wars during the defense of Kashyyyk, the Galactic Civil War by aiding the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire, and the war against the First Order. They were quite strong, and were known to rip people's arms out of their sockets when provoked. Though being from a temperate planet better known for its swamps and forests, they were able to be comfortable on icy worlds such as Ilum and Hoth without any protective clothing, including gloves and boots.<br></p><h3 style="font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif">Biology and appearance</h3><blockquote><p><i>"Would somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?"</i></p><p>- Princess Leia referring to Chewbacca</p></blockquote><p>Wookiees were a tall species of furry giants from the planet Kashyyyk, who could grow to a height of nearly three meters. They were covered from head to toe in a thick, shaggy coat of hair with water-shedding properties that notably came in shades of brown, black, gray, and white. The species had two sexes, female and male. The latter grew long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye color ranged from blue to brown. Wookiees were big eaters, with the average adult requiring 3,500-6,000 calories a day of food.</p><p>Wookiees had extendable claws which they used for climbing; using them for anything else violated the Wookiee honor code. Despite their fearsome appearance and volatile temperament, Wookiees were regarded as intelligent, sophisticated, loyal and trusting. When angered, Wookiees were known to descend into a berserker rage. Wookiees had a long lifespan, appearing not to age over a span of fifty years. One Wookiee, Lohgarra, lived healthily for centuriesâ€”the only distinction being her white fur. They could learn to understand other languages, like Galactic Basic, but they were physically unable to speak them. To those who had not learned to understand Shyriiwook, the Wookiee language, it appeared they spoke in a series of growls and purrs. Although rare, it was possible for Wookiees to be born Force-sensitive and become Jedi, a source of great pride. One such Wookiee was the youngling Gungi.</p><p>While Wookiees did not like eating blosphi extract, it provided them with enough nutrition to survive.</p><h3 style="font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif">History</h3><p><b>The Clone Wars</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have."</i></p><p>- Jedi Master Yoda</p></blockquote><p>Wookiees originated on the Mid Rim forest planet of Kashyyyk. In the ancient past, they invented and crafted weapons that fired poisoned darts and arrows. During the Clone Wars and the reign of King Grakchawwaa, the Wookiees remained fiercely loyal to the Galactic Republic and fought alongside them in several star systems. Towards the end of the conflict, Wookiee forces also defended their homeworld from a Separatist invasion with the help of Galactic Republic forces led by Jedi Master Yoda, who had good relations with them.</p><p><b>Age of the Empire</b></p><p>Following the establishment of the Galactic Empire, the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk was blockaded by the Empire. The softening and repeal of anti-slavery laws ultimately led to the Empire classifying the Wookiees as non-sentient. The Empire enslaved the Wookiees not because they were a meaningful threat to the Empire but because their massive, robust physiology allowed them to work long and hard in extreme conditions.</p><p>As a result, many Wookiees were forced into slavery working to build much of the Imperial war machine, sent to be worked to death in the dangerous spice mines of the planet Kessel, or on construction sites such as the Death Star, though a number escaped this fate. Numerous Wookiees were bred for use in medical experimentation, and some were used as playthings for Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck, Imperial governor of Kashyyyk, who occasionally hunted live Wookiees for sport.</p><p>To keep them in line, all of the Wookiees on Kashyyyk were fitted with inhibitor chips that caused them great pain if activated. The Empire also quickly learned the most efficient way of preventing any wide-scale uprisings was by threatening clan and family members, particularly the younglings. Normally, a Wookiee would quite willingly rip a stormtrooper limb from limb regardless of their own safety, but could not bear to see other Wookiees subjected to the agony instead.</p><p>Despite these grave circumstances for their race, the Wookiees nonetheless found ways to help others. In the early days of the Empire, the Outer Rim planet of Lasan, home to the Lasat, was brutally sacked and devastated by the Empire for daring to question the new regime. Unable to stand by and watch, many Wookiees went to Lasan and fought the Empire with weapons forged from the wroshyr trees of their homeworld, in many cases giving their own lives to save the Lasats. Because of their actions, a few Lasats (including Garazeb Orrelios) were able to escape the genocide and survive in the wider galaxy.</p><p>During the Age of the Empire, the-then Commodore Thrawn and Lieutenant Commander Eli Vanto discovered evidence that the Empire was transporting enslaved Wookiees after responding to a distress transmission from the troop transport Sempre. The Wookiee slaves were liberated by a task force consisting of the frigate Castilus and two squadrons of V-19 Torrent starfighters, which then attacked the space station Lansend Twenty-Six, where more Wookiee slaves were held. Thrawn commanded the operation to reinforce Baklek Base and forced the insurgents to surrender. When Vanto objected to slavery, Thrawn tried to rationalize the Empire's enslavement of Wookiees.</p><p>About fourteen years after the establishment of the Empire, the 212th Attack Battalion led by General Kahdah quelled a Wookiee revolt on Kashyyyk. Civilian travel to the planet was restricted and access was granted only for official government business. Shortly later, the Empire transported several captives including Wullffwarro and his son Kitwarr to the spice mines of Kessel. The Spectres, a rebel cell based on the Outer Rim world of Lothal, rescued the prisoners and escaped Kessel.</p><p><b>Joining the Rebellion</b></p><p>During the Galactic Civil War, several Wookiees including Chewbacca and Lohgarra fought for the Alliance to Restore the Republic and its successor government, the New Republic. One year following the Battle of Endor, the Wookiee homeworld had become an Imperial remnant known as Imperial territory G5-623 led by Grand Moff Tolruck. Kashyyyk was later liberated by the New Republic forces. Working with a group of rebels led by Han Solo and Chewbacca, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, used a hyperspace transceiver to neutralize Tolruck's inhibitor chips. This enabled the Wookiees to rise up en-masse against the Imperial occupiers and take their well-earned revenge, with Grand Moff Tolruck himself being killed by his personal slave, Cracktooth. The Imperial forces attempted to orbital bombard Kashyyyk but were defeated by a New Republic fleet led by Leia Organa and Admiral Ackbar.<br></p><p>Wookiee and New Republic forces then conducted mopping-up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. During one of these skirmishes, Chewbacca reunited with his son, Lumpawaroo, who had escaped from a slave labor camp run by Commandant Dessard.</p><p><b>New Republic era</b></p><p>During the New Republic era, Kashyyyk's forests including the Black Forest grew back. Many Wookiees including Chewbacca and Chief Karasshki lived in villages. About two years after the Battle of Jakku, the rogue Pau'an surgeon Fyzen Gor began kidnapping and killing Wookiee younglings to use as spare parts for his droid followers, the Original Dozen. Due to his shadowy appearance, he earned the nickname the "Long Man." Chewbacca agreed to help Han Solo and Lando Calrissian retrieve the Phylanx Redux Transmitter in return recovering the limbs of the murdered Wookiees for funeral rites.</p><h3 style="font-family:&quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif"><b>Society and culture</b></h3><p>Most Wookiees carried bowcasters as weaponry, which were handcrafted. The Wookiee people by and large hated Trandoshans, who were renowned as great hunters. The highest way a Wookiee could compliment someone was to groom them. In Wookiee society, loyalty and courage were valued as sacrosanct tenets.</p><p><b>Wookiees in the Galaxy</b></p><blockquote><p><i>"A Wookiee! Rare you are to the Jedi. Proud, your people must be."</i></p><p>- Professor Huyang to Gungi</p></blockquote><p>Some notable Wookiees included Chewbacca, the navigator and long-time companion of Han Solo. Other noteworthy Wookiees including the chief and general Tarfful (who fought alongside Master Yoda during the Battle of Kashyyyk), the warrior Wullffwarro, and his son Kitwarr. One known Force-sensitive Wookiee was the Jedi youngling Gungi, who lived during the Clone Wars. During the Age of the Empire, Black Krrsantan was a Wookiee who worked as a bounty hunter for both Jabba the Hutt and Darth Vader.</p><p>Another Wookiee Greybok played an important role in turning the tide of the Battle of Sevarcos by freeing several rancors, which rampaged the Imperial lines. He later took part in Han Solo and Chewbacca's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk. While serving as a senator in the New Republic's Galactic Senate, Leia Organa once saw two Wookiee commuters in front of her on an automated sidewalk at the New Republic senatorial complex on Hosnian Prime.</p><br><br><br><br></body></html>
