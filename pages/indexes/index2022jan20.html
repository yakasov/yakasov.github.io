    "sorry. that was a very long answer to your question.<br />so to answer, i
    would say that no, i'm not depressed."<br /><br />
  </p>
  <p>"but sad?"<br /><br /></p>
  <p>"sure."<br /><br /></p>
  <p>"why is that - how is that different?"<br /><br /></p>
  <p>
    "depression is a serious illness.<br />it's physically painful,
    debilitating.<br />and you can't just decide to get over it in the same way
    you get over cancer.<br />sadness is a normal human condition, no different
    from happiness.<br />you wouldn't think of happiness as an illness.<br />sadness
    and happiness need each other.<br />to exist, each relies on the other, is
    what i mean."<br /><br />
