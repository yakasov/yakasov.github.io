<h2> <i> default iMovie intro </i> <br>
<i> beat starts </i> <br>
<i> rides in on silly looking bicycle </i> <br>
<i> dismounts bicycle and drops it to the ground like a hard man </i> <br>
Yo <br>
<i>adjusts earphone </i> <br>
FBC Freestyle <br>
Let’s go <br>
<i>rocks head to beat he made in GarageBand with presets </i><br>
Went from learning square roots to shotting squares and bunning zoots <br>
Did maths on the out drawn pads <br>
The teacher shouted at me to patent it <br>
Now I’m flying away with Saturn <br>
Got my chinos sweatshirt and bottoms to match <br>
But I have been depressed <br>
Years have progressed <br>
To the vets I’m depressed since the day I held that knife to my chest <br>
<i>points at side that the heart is not actually on </i><br>
My mind must’ve been possessed <br>
When I saw that balmy skinny chest <br>
Where the treasure it rests <br>
Even this world is a mess <br>
I realise now that I’m blessed <br>
Flopping walking the miles to the door risking lives to find water <br>
Gang shooting this is wars bruv <br>
Risking lives the Gucci belts to keep the stores up <br>
What about my family’s poor, huh? <br>
Now I’ve got my chance gonna smash it with a hammer <br>
Then dash like Mo Farah <br>
Cash in my bunk <br>
Trashing don’t matter <br>
Look at my credentials, see the potential <br>
But half of me’s gentle <br>
Hearts looking mental <br>
I’ve got two sides of me, I can be Hyde and I'm Jekyll <br>
In disguise <br>
Used to get high thought why looked up to the sky <br>
<i>points both hands to sky to make interesting contrast to same hand movements throughout the previous verse </i><br>
Then I saw outsiders and thought why don’t I live full time <br>
Trying to find a better life, be a unique man <br>
<i>slowly getting more aggressive at the pavement </i><br>
But the amount of times I made my mum cry <br>
Didn’t give a fuck that’s why <br>
Thought nothing mattered <br>
<i>looks at camera to be philosophical </i><br>
Because we’re all gonna die <br>
<i>pause </i><br>
But now <br>
Now I think I see the light <br>
Yo <br>
What would you do <br>
If you knew <br>
Tomorrow you’d be dead <br>
You make the most of every second <br>
<i>ironic because this entire video was kind of a waste of time anyway </i><br>
And appreciate being fed <br>
Appreciate the easy bowl to run <br>
And get to sleep in a bed <br>
The easy road you’re on <br>
The hashtag glow auch ton red <br>
And when you turn red <br>
Don’t just start bunning green <br>
Don’t wait for to let you through <br>
Till it goes amber then just get lean <br>
Drive straight through like you aint being seen <br>
Drive straight through like you living your dream <br>
Driving through in my limousine <br>
<i>also ironic because his dad drives a Toyota Corolla </i><br>
Age is a number, I am 16 <br>
<i>not sure why he chose to add that line in there because its mostly used as a joke that pedophiles use to groom children and tricking them into thinking that they can have sex regardless of their age </i> <br>
driving right here right into the scene <br>
Don’t care what you say bruv you aint bother me <br>
Score a goal like a referee <br>
<i>sudden political turn </i><br>
Then why do they allow corrupt police <br>
<i>actually only 279 corrupt police have been reported over the last 12 months in the UK </i><br>
And let people live on spare pennies <br>
the UK is one of the only countries to have a benefits system <br>
While billions they have many <br>
<i>top fifth only have 40% of the total UK economy which is actually quite good when compared to many other countries </i><br>
They should let people have an equal draw <br>
<i>benefits system… </i><br>
Don’t let the government say no <br>
Just go to war <br>
<i>anarchy mate… no. </i><br>
What about the civilians they ignore the poor <br>
why you bitching about the poor mate your tracksuit alone is like 60 quid <br>
In other words theyre killing them <br>
<i>benefits……… </i><br>
Cause we live in a world where as long as you stay wealthy, you can kill others and stay healthy <br>
<i>fair point mate I back you on that one </i><br>
We don’t need a politician <br>
<i>we do tho </i><br>
We need a leader <br>
<i>like north korea? </i><br>
Who is on a mission <br>
<i>to destroy America and Japan, yeah </i><br>
To clean up <br>
<i>oh </i><br>
England parreuuauaa espangnanana francaiiiis jongeuuauai ali lame aqui qua <br>
We got a time limit but no mind limit <br>
Only got one life in this world <br>
Reach high with it <br>
That's what I'm doing <br>
Just my thing, till I'm king <br>
Carry on the grind <br>
<i> literally 2 lines of a different language </i> <br>
Until the whole fucking world knows my name <br>
<i>2 months and 2.5k views </i><br>
Yo <br>
<b> Dylusion </b><br>
Remember the name <br>
I’m out <br>
<i>presumably picks up bike and rides away like a roadman ting </i><br>
</h2>
