    <h2>
      Yo <br>
      FBC Freestyle <br>
      Let’s go <br>
      Went from learning square roots to shotting squares and bunning zoots <br>
      Did maths on the out drawn pads <br>
      The teacher shouted at me to patent it <br>
      Now I’m flying away with Saturn <br>
      Got a Moschino sweatshirt and bottoms to match <br>
      But I have been depressed <br>
      Years have progressed <br>
      To the vets I’m depressed since the day I held that knife to my chest <br>
      My mind must’ve been possessed <br>
      When I saw that bony skinny chest <br>
      Where the treasure it rests <br>
      Even this world is a mess <br>
      I realise now that I’m blessed <br>
      Flopping walking 20 miles to the door risking lives to find water <br>
      Gang shooting this is wars bruv <br>
      Risking lives the Gucci belts to keep the stores up <br>
      What about my family’s poor, huh? <br>
      Now I’ve got my chance gonna smash it with a hammer <br>
      Then dash like Mo Farah <br>
      Cash in my bunk <br>
      Trashing don’t matter <br>
      Look at my credentials, see the potential <br>
      But half of me’s gentle <br>
      Hearts looking mental <br>
      I’ve got two sides of me, I can be hyper and I'm Jekyll <br>
      In disguise <br>
      Used to get high thought why looked up to the sky <br>
      Then I saw outsiders and thought why don’t I live full time <br>
      Trying to find a better life, got a unique mind <br>
      But the amount of times I made my mum cry <br>
      Didn’t give a fuck that’s why <br>
      Thought nothing mattered <br>
      Because we’re all gonna die <br>
      But now <br>
      Now I think I see the light <br>
      Yo <br>
      What would you do <br>
      If you knew <br>
      Tomorrow you’d be dead <br>
      You make the most of every second <br>
      And appreciate being fed <br>
      Appreciate the easy world you run <br>
      And get to sleep in a bed <br>
      The easy road you’re on <br>
      The hashtag glow auch ton red <br>
      And when you turn red <br>
      Don’t just start bunning green <br>
      Don’t wait for it to let you through <br>
      Till it goes amber then just get lean <br>
      Drive straight through like you ain't being seen <br>
      Drive straight through like you living your dream <br>
      Driving through in my limousine <br>
      Age is a number, I am 16 <br>
      drove right here right into the scene <br>
      Don’t care what you say bruv you aint bother me <br>
      Score a goal like a referee <br>
      Hitting my bars like ABC <br>
      I ain't chipmunk but I'm in my own league <br>
      <b> (someone's name) </b> nah that's not me <br>
      <b> unknown lines </b> <br>
      Sittin at home writing raps, making beats <br>
      Used to fuck about, out playing in the streets <br>
      Then I went to fest and saw Bugzy <br>
      One day I'll be on stage just like Jay-Z <br>
      Yeah <br>
      That's easy-peasy <br>
      <b> (unknown words) </b> just breezing <br>
      Hittin' bars constantly like breathing <br>
      Allow all of the man like <b> (unknown word) </b> <br>
      New EP come and see this is teasing <br>
      Can't wait for the day I release it <br>
      Worked hard for this, banging keys in <br>
      Opportunity comes and I seize it <br>
      This is no expert mic covered in sponge <br>
      My mum uses for cleaning <br>
      I just don't care what you call it <br>
      Grime, rap, hip-hop, pop, punk, rock <br>
      Call it poetry, I'm on them like I'm Shakespeare <br>
      <b> unknown lines </b> <br>
      I drove past <b> (unknown words) </b><br>
      But they're jerkin' or lurkin' <br>
      But I'm workin' <br>
      This work rate is stronger than an earthquake </br>
      Everyday's my birthday <br>
      Then why do they allow corrupt police <br>
      And let people live on spare pennies <br>
      the UK is one of the only countries to have a benefits system <br>
      While billions they have many <br>
      They should let people have an equal draw <br>
      Don’t let the government say no <br>
      Just go to war <br>
      What about the civilians they ignore the poor <br>
      why you bitching about the poor mate your tracksuit alone is like 60 quid <br>
      In other words theyre killing them <br>
      Cause we live in a world where as long as you stay wealthy, you can kill others and stay healthy <br>
      We don’t need a politician <br>
      We need a leader <br>
      Who is on a mission <br>
      To clean up <br>
      England parreuuauaa espangnanana francaiiiis jongeuuauai ali lame aqui qua <br>
      We got a time limit but no mind limit <br>
      Only got one life in this world <br>
      Reach high with it <br>
      That's what I'm doing <br>
      Just my thing, till I'm king <br>
      Carry on the grind <br>
      Until the whole fucking world knows my name <br>
      Yo <br>
      <b> Dylusion </b><br>
      Remember the name <br>
      I’m out <br>
